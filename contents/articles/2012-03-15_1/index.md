![New Mavic rain jacket](http://f.slowtheory.com/6977394449_ef1169d6e5_m.jpg) It was a good weekend for me. After running fourteen miles on Thursday I filled out the weekend with: 

- 1.5hrs cycling (Friday)  
- 2.5hrs fast cycling (Saturday)  
- 1hr running hill repeats (Sunday)  
- 2hrs cycling (Sunday)  
- 1.5hrs cycling (Monday)   
- 40min running (Monday)  

I tried a new hill for repeats on Sunday. Because of the warm weather I was able to use a little known* half-dirt* hill near Lake Street and the River Road. It winds through the woods to the river, and offers a very nice length and grade for repeated efforts. Additionally, it is conveniently located one mile from my house, allowing for easy warm-up and cool-down.  
  
I'm not much of a gear junkie, but lately I've really been digging my new-to-me Mavic rain jacket. While some of the gratuitous, almost absurd gizmos don't interest me, the more functional features (pit zips, intelligently placed pockets, detachable hood, etc) and superb fit have made this an instant favorite. 

![Ouch](http://f.slowtheory.com/6981950453_0c024e80f3_m.jpg) Tuesday, my day was going pretty well until I was thoroughly owned by a torx bolt while installing a rotor. The tool slipped off the head of the bolt. I recall only hitting my finger on the axle, but must have passed it through the rotor first. The wound was impressive. After six years without creating a workplace incident, I found myself being whisked away to Urgent Care by my girlfriend. Four stitches and a couple hours later, I could return to my normal life. Cycling the next morning was a little bit awkard, but otherwise I'm complaint-free.
