Today I was riding along Como peacefully returning from a trip to the grocery store when my thoughts were interrupted by a blaring horn and the shrill sound  of an irritating woman’s voice yelling, “Get outta da way!” Now, mind you, the streets were nearly deserted, as it was quite late in the evening, and there was plenty of room for the woman to maneuver her minivan easily around me. I  caught up to her at the next stoplight and ran my hand over her windows and gently slapped her mirror. She yelled and sounded her horn. I expected her to follow me and was planning my escape route, but apparently the extent of her bravado was to startle an unassuming bicyclist who just wanted to get home and  make himself a meager dinner.  

Nothing else happened today. I rode my bike to the park and on the way unclipped while skidding to the great amusement of anyone who might have been  peering out the front window of Dunn Brothers in Saint Anthony Village. Every time I see headlights I think you’re hiding behind them. I haven’t heard back from UPS. I’ve been looking for other jobs in the interim while I watch my money slowing drip away. Something will happen, soon.
