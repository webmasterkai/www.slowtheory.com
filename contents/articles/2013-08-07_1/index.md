![One step closer to a sponsorship deal.](http://f.slowtheory.com/9466406327_56072dd9e8_n.jpg "One step closer to a sponsorship deal.") This weekend I'm going to participate in the Powderhorn 24 . I last rode the event in 2010, when [I joined Michelle and some of her friends](http://www.slowtheory.com/2011/08/18/summer/) on a team of six. This time, we're going to be a team of three, but we're definitely not there to race. In fact, I'm going to sneak in a few running laps just because I 1.) can't afford to miss a training day this close to Superior, and 2.) I'll get bored riding my bike. I'll be joining former Cycles for Change coworkers Micah and Eugene.

Prior to the 24 hour bike thing, I'm going to attend my third Friday morning Mill City run. I may try to find a slower pace than I have the last couple weeks, but I want to keep myself in the habit of going. Making a ritual out of a weekly run is something I've often dreamt about, but not had the faculties or tenacity to employ.

Hoka felt bad that I keep destroying Bondis, so they sent me some Hoka branded goodies. I think that's one step away from being a sponsored athlete.
