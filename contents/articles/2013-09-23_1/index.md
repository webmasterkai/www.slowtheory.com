Much of this year has been spent doing things that blur the line between running and hiking. The last time that I did a 20+ miler exclusively on pavement, and sort of fast, was April 6th. In the five months that followed, I completed *six* runs of 26 miles or more, but none at a faster pace than 10:35min/mile. Those six runs were on trails that ranged from medium to highly technical, with the exception being the chocolate muffin run (which had its own "unique" difficulties and still included 40% trail). Despite periodically throwing in shorter, faster runs, I really had no idea what to expect from my road running fitness. After squeezing my way into Twin Cities under another person's name, I decided that I should find out. A training run was in order.

Fortunately my friend Micah does a 20 miler each and every Sunday. I decided to join him. He's a 3:12 marathoner, so I was pleased that 1.) I'd be with someone who could push me, and 2.) due to his intense training schedule and highly compassionate nature, he was going to take it easy enough that I wouldn't be vomiting by mile two. I hopped on my bike and rode to his house. It was a chilly morning, perfect for running. We started south towards Minnehaha. The amount of rest that I've taken over the past two weeks, coupled with the perfectly cool morning, immediately put me at ease. I felt comfortable and was enjoying catching up with Micah. We worked together at Cycles for Change, but haven't seized the opportunity to spend a lot of time together over the past two months since I left.

Our route took us through Fort Snelling to Pike Island. The time was passing quickly. I love quiet mornings on Pike Island. There were a few other runners out, but mostly it was just the two of us enjoying a morning in the woods. We did a lap each direction and were soon on the climb back to the falls. We'd passed the half marathon point, and I still felt at ease. My water intake is a good barometer of my effort level, and I wasn't even through the single 20 ounce bottle that I carried. Things were going well. The 50 has certainly changed my perspective on distance--being within seven miles of the finish seemed like we were almost done.

We ran along the Parkway, still chatting and saying hello to other runners. As we turned off the parkway, Micah dropped the pace dramatically. Oh boy. I followed and watched as we dipped below 8 minutes per pile, then below 7 minutes per mile. The only spot where it really hurt was on a slight downhill. I'm not a good downhill runner, but we soon reached an incline and I was comfortable again. Whew. I really need to learn how to run downhill. It's difficult for me to run fast with the fractured sesamoid, but my goofy looking Hokas has made it much more tolerable (and it's completely solved the plantar fasciitis issue that I had in the winter and spring). 

We ran the last six blocks easy, ate some apples, and I biked home. Some things that made this run very promising:

- We stopped for only 1 minute, 40 seconds
- I felt great and finished strong with a couple of sub 8 minute miles
- I survived on only 20 ounces of water
- My feet felt great
- 8:32 min/mile pace overall, with our slowest miles being the first few
- nothing zany...it was just a normal run
- I had fun!

I think this bodes really well for my Twin Cities effort. My "A goal" for the race is 3:30, with my "B goal" being 3:45. "C goal"? Beat my previous marathon PR, which seems almost impossible *not* to do.
