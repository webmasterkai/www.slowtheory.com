Last night, I determined my 2013 *race schedule*.Â After several rounds of elimination, only trail running races remain. Over the past couple years, I have had difficulty connecting with my cycling friends. Some have stopped riding, while others have been forced into a state of habitual inconsistency by competing life demands. This is not to suggest that my drift to another sport is not of my own volition, but simply to acknowledge that I don't love cycling enough to spend hours alone with it. Anyway, here's the list:  
  
- [Winter Wilder 30k][1] - January 12th 
- [Zumbro 17 mile][2] - April 13th 
- [Ice Age 50k ][3]- May 11th 
- [Afton 50k][4] - July 6th 
- [Battle Creek trail marathon][5] - August 24th 
- [Superior 50 mile ][6]- September 7th  
  
Superior is one day after my birthday. It's going to be great.
