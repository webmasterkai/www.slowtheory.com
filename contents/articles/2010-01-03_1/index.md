saturday: I was ready to participate in the north shore ultra with my coworker and friend, dave. I was excited. the temperatures would be low, but there would be little wind and the snow on the trails would be hard and fast. I was excited. dave was excited. he'd put a lot of energy, money, time and effort into preparing for the race. I had done the same. for a lot of people the event was going to be little more than a warmup for the arrowhead, but for us (and perhaps others) it was going to be the event of winter. from the time I signed up until two days before the race I heard little from the organizer. he did not post on the website, was not quick to respond to emails, and seemed to be doing little to promote the event. two days before the race it was inexplicably canceled. the excuse? I'm not sure. it was one of those rambling, ill conceived emails in which several excuses are attempted with none being particularly convincing. the insurance? really? I mean, how many people would you expect to show up to a snow bike race in january? especially in its first year. isn't that something that you looked into while calculating registration fees? snow conditions? really? the snow is basically concrete right now, and with such a short loop it would pack down nicely and/or allow people to exit the race as necessary. it was poorly executed and to further enliven my ire, he's yet to offer any kind of refund on registration fees, even after I sent an email asking for a refund.

sunday. I spent the early part of the week contemplating whether I wanted to ride with group A or group B. these are two different groups of friends that ride bicycles in such dramatically different ways that it is almost impossible to merge the two. group A would entail a short mountain bike ride while group B would be a longer ride on roads and plowed bike trails. my decision to ride with group B was based largely on the historical unreliability of group A. I was almost certain that they would cancel, and that they would do so in such an unwieldy fashion as to make it impossible to make plans with group B. while I find the windless cold to be much more tolerable than warmer temperatures with more extreme wind, I knew that the likelihood of cancellation from either group was high. saturday night I checked my messages many times to ensure that things were still as planned. I suggested stopping points for warming up and offered up the extra cold weather gear that I had in my arsenal. sunday morning I checked my messages a final time and headed out the door. I reached our meeting point just over ten miles from my front door to find that I had three text messages on my phone. cancellations. one eighteen minutes and the other nine minutes before the proposed meeting time. I understand that sometimes people cannot follow through with their commitments, but to have three cancellations in the same weekend without any compelling reason was more than just a little bit irritating, doubly so because all of them were made so late that I had no choice about my plans. I would have ridden my bike anyway, but I would have either tried to make plans with other people or ridden somewhere more interesting. I also would not have left during the coldest part of the day. those were accommodations made to suit other people and their schedules. likewise, the cancellation of the north shore ultra meant canceling hotel reservations at the last minute and arranging and de-arranging rides.

sunday. I had a nice ride anyway. it was completely still outside and smoke and steam filled the air and made it beautiful in a perplexing way.
