We patched random holes in the wall. I need to start getting more *before* shots, but the one pictured below was created when the former owners ran plumbing to the third floor. The sewer pipe was too large, so it protruded into the sheetrock patch. Their solution? Cover it with a plate. Ours? A piece of very thin wood to forever conceal the ghastly hack. Outlet was later replaced.

My parents have spent a lot of time helping us over the past several weeks. My dad is pretty handy, having been an electrician, cabinet maker, and the architect behind my childhood home. It's a shame that more of that didn't rub off of me.

And finally, the nearly completed bedroom. We just need to do some touch-up around the trim.
