Saturday I was riding to work enjoying the beautiful morning when my bike lurched forward and made a horrifying crunching, crackling, death cry. At first I thought my freewheel had broken, but I knew that was impossible since it was a white industries singlespeed freewheel. I checked my bottom bracket and that seemed fine too. I hopped back on my bike and still things weren't right. The left crankarm flopped forward and was out of sync with the drive side arm. Thinking that it had somehow loosened I pulled out my allen key and tried to tighten it. It was tight. It dawned on me that I'd probably broken the spindle that is integrated into the drive side arm. I pulled on it and sure enough, it fell right out.

Today a record six people met at the bike shop for a fat tire adventure ride. It's sort of becoming an annual tradition to fall into the river at least once around this time of year. After a rough start we found some nice places to ride and I had an opportunity to give the new fatbike its proper shakedown ride. Everything worked great. The crappy platform pedals that I rode started to click at the end of the ride, but it should be easy enough to rectify that by tossing them in the trash. I fell into the river exactly once when the bottom disappeared. Others did better. Others still did worse. I think fun was had by all. I took disappointingly few pictures as I was spending most of my time trying to remain upright and dry.
