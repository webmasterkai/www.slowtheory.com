After much deliberation, indecision and anxiety I finally settled on spending some of my vacation time hiking a section of the superior hiking trail with Ryan. Thursday. Late start. I had a few things to do in the morning, including going to the Roseville license center to renew my seldom used Minnesota driver's license. I was slow getting ready. I got home in the early afternoon and still had to pack. I did so quickly, knowingly forgetting important items but unwilling to devote the necessary time to identifying them. Oh well. I knew that I had a shelter, a few articles of clothing, and something to hold water. What else could I possibly need? It was unique in that it was strictly a backpacking trip. No bikes. We left Ryan's just as rush hour traffic was clogging the interstates. Time passed. We sat in traffic. We accelerated. Talked. Flirted with sleep. Stopped for candy. Etc.

We still didn't have an exact plan by the time we reached Duluth. I started perusing the guidebook, figuring out where we'd spend the night and begin our hike in the morning. As much as I was enticed by the thought of spending the night at Castle Danger, we opted to go a bit farther north to Beaver Bay. There was a campsite just a mile from the parking lot. It was late. We started down an ATV trail until we reached the Beaver River. We followed this another quarter mile until we reached the first campsite. There was no one there. The moon was blinding.

I set up my hammock. It was cool, but not cold. After considering it, I decided to sleep without the rainfly so that I could wake up to the sky. It was not long before we saw two more headlamps inching their way through the darkness. Bruce and Donna. They introduced themselves and set up their tent next to the fire pit. I had been looking forward to a nice fire before bed. Oh well. I went to bed. It was wonderful sleeping weather. I woke up once during the night. The moon had worked its way overhead and illuminated the forest. It was beautiful. I went back to sleep and did not wake up again until morning. The moon had been replaced by the sun. I walked around getting a better impression of our surroundings.

I took Beth's camera, so I spent a while sitting by the river trying to get the light settings right. I think it paid off as the best photos that I took came from the first day. Towards the end of the trip I didn't take enough time and ended up with poor colors, too much light, too little light, etc. Nonetheless, it was extremely nice to have a camera more capable of translating what I was seeing to pixels. We packed up our things and made a plan for the day. Just over nine miles. An easy first day. We continued along the beaver river. It was gorgeous. The river narrowed and rushed over waterfalls. We stopped a lot in the first mile.

Eventually we moved away from the river. I had been visually spoiled. Nothing could match the unsurpassable beauty of hiking along a ridge above a rushing river. As we continued the terrain became more challenging. Steep ascents, technical descents. As is my habit, I had the wrong shoes for hiking. In fact, I couldn't even find my trail running shoes, so I was wearing neutral cushioning road running shoes. I didn't expect it to be a problem as I didn't anticipate much elevation change. I was wrong.

We hiked rather uneventfully for a couple hours before reaching the breathtaking overlook above Bean lake. Wow. I could not possibly capture the expansiveness. The color of the water on the clear, bright day. It thoroughly amazed and entranced both of us. Ryan stopped for at least two hundred photos.

We climbed higher. It grew hotter and we were more exposed to the sun. I packed very poorly, bringing only wool shirts and two twenty-seven ounce water bottles. We were quickly running out of water. We stopped and got water from Penn Creek. It was moving, albeit slowly, and clear. Tempting. We filled our bottles with the intention of boiling it when we had the chance. Bear lake was up ahead and a possible lunch destination. When we reached the turn to go to the lake we looked down at a steep, jagged descent over a hundred vertical feet to the lake. Fuck that. We were both quite dehydrated by this time. Cheers. Delicious, unfiltered, unboiled creek water. It was amazing. We reached our next stop by mid-afternoon. Unpacked. Started a fire. Deliberated.

We ate dinner, talked to our new neighbors, and watched the fire burn. I had the opportunity to use my sven saw for the first time. It worked beautifully. Because of an early season ice storm, there was ample firewood. Trees down everywhere. Twisted, ripped from the ground, left to decay. Cruel nature.

Towards morning I got cold. Really cold. I climbed out of my hammock, put on everything in my bag and tried to go back to sleep. It was near dawn and pinecones rained from the sky. I stopped fighting it and got up. After eating breakfast we hiked a bit farther to Mount Trudee. We had temporarily settled on an out and back, dividing the return trip into two days and tacking on a climb up the nearby mountain. After our morning hike we returned to camp. We loaded our gear, intending to hike another six miles to Penn Creek. Since it was going to be a short day we stopped at Bear Lake. It was staggering. I thought perhaps the beauty of the lake was amplified because we were high above it on a ridge, that all of the smaller, ugly details were hidden from view. As it came into focus, as I could touch it, I knew that I was wrong. The temperature was at least ten degrees cooler by the lake and there was a nice breeze. We took a swimming break.

I felt clean. I felt refreshed, revitalized. I really wanted to spend the night, but the fact that it was borderline cool by the lake during the heat of the day meant that I would have been extremely cold at night. I packed light. I should have brought insulation for the bottom of my hammock. Hennessy makes a product now that attaches to the bottom for cold weather camping. I need it. I want it. We continued to the Penn Creek campground. The trail sharply descended to the camping area. When we reached the bottom we found that there was not an accessible water source. We decided to continue another six miles back to the Beaver river campsite. I'm not sure what rash, impulsive decision making process prompted this. Water? Maybe. Doubtful. Hiking and additional six miles of difficult terrain certainly couldn't have been easier than making a couple trips for water. The truth is that I was homesick. I wanted to be back earlier on Sunday. I hoped that I might get to see Beth before she left for a couple days to Faribault. It was just what I sought in a vacation. Emptying. Becoming nothing, and reemerging from that expansive nothingness as something new, something changed.
