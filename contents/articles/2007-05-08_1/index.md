your weathered caress  
old man old man you were surprised  
that after a thousand mornings  
you could experience something unique  
not even touching her body  
but just settling in imagination  
reciting wonderment  
willing to be obsessed  
with the things you've touched  
so what is it now  
old man old man hands  
is it a touch of remorse?  
a sinking sensation in  
your stomach  
that you don't feel shit anymore?  
leathery sick dimpled old  
man hands  
touching something soft  
trying to feel better  
except there isn't a body  
and your wonderment is make believe  
and she's screaming inside  
pale soft textureless  
stained gritty torturous  
in front of the mirror  
comparing like parts  
fecklessly joined  
hand shoulder hand shoulder  
heads canted downward  
do you feel ugly now?
