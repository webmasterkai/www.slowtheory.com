Jeff and I decided to take advantage of the south wind and head north. *No, you don't understand*. We decided to ride north and arrange for an incredibly generous and understanding friend to retrieve us in her automobile at the other end. The destination was Duluth. Jeff has a history of riding to Duluth at least once a summer. I've done it once, but split the trip into two days. With the strong tailwind I figured it would be easy. We met at the bike shop at 8am.  
  
Getting through the suburbs took a bit of time, but once we were on the open road we were cruising. Although the tailwind wasn't as direct as I imagined it would be, we were moving fast and I was feeling great. It wasn't long before we were in Wyoming, MN. We stopped for doughnuts and soda. Ride food. I followed Jeff for much of the remaining distance to Hinckley. I was in the kind of trance that one achieves by staring for way too long at a dryer with a glass door.  
  
Once we got to the Munger our tailwind all but disappeared. The trees shielded us and only infrequently would we break into the open and feel the surge of being pushed along by the wind. I contemplated cutting back to highway 61. As I approached 100 miles I realized that I was going to break five hours ride time for a century. That was a cool revelation as it was by far my best century time to date. Around Finlayson the combination of heat and hunger started to make itself apparent. We stopped at a gas station where Jeff chugged chocolate milk and I consumed a bounty of unsatisfying gas station products.  
  
From Finlayson to Carlton I was really up and down. I felt great for a moment and then felt like shit. I could sense that the heat was really taking its toll on my hydration, but I just couldn't seem to drink enough. Jeff appeared to be in the same situation as his jersey, helmet and shorts were all covered in salt. We took another short stop at Carlton under a picnic shelter. Jeff was stretched out on the concrete (I have a great photo of this once I get my camera back). I was sure that he was going to fall asleep for a few hours so I forced us to get moving again. The last stretch into Duluth wouldn't be that difficult. Aside from a surprise headwind for the final ten miles due to lake wind, that was mostly correct.  
  
We met Jeni in canal park, ate dinner, and collapsed into a napcoma for the ride home. The day's stats: 169.3 miles in 8 hours and 40 minutes ride time. Roughly 10 hours total time, stops included. Not bad. Too bad it made me so tired.
