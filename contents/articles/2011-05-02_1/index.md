For a few reasons (a mild injury among them) I opted not to ride the Minnesota Ironman Gran Fondo on Sunday.  
  
Instead I had brunch with Michelle and friends, went to the Mayday parade, ate at Gandhi Mahal, and participated in the no name alleycat. Aside from *freezing* for a couple hours waiting for the parade to begin, it was a very good day.  
  
Kudos to everyone who rode on such a miserable day. I know and have ridden with the people who finished 1st, 3rd, 8th and 10th. Wow.
