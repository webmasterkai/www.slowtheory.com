![P1040534](http://f.slowtheory.com/6844640906_b661dd57e7.jpg "P1040534") Spring came unexpectedly. I woke up, looked outside, and very suddenly it was spring. In a way, it never stopped being spring. The colors began to *re-saturate* and the need to charge my bike lights diminished, but the sensations did not change. I began riding more, and running faster, but the remarkable sameness stripped this year of its transitional rebirth. It has been a long time since I have written here, so I will recap in a very organized way:  
  
- **Dental work**: About a month ago, I had my wisdom teeth removed. For a long time, I have feared and dreaded the procedure. The process ended up being as painless as one could expect. Michelle took care of me, getting me safely to my appointment, bringing me home, and feeding me blended *everything* for a few days. My recovery was quick. Nine days after the operation, I managed a 14 mile run. More recently, I had a crown *installed* on one of my lower molars. Next week, I will have a crown on the same tooth on the other side of my mouth. Then, *my dental work will be done*. Financial implications have forced me to delay much of this work for years, but I decided that I would just *do it* and somehow make it work financially. I feel good about it.
- **Weight Loss**: My weight loss slowed in March, but I have managed to get down to 161 pounds. The lowest weight I recall holding as an adult is 155 pounds, so I am almost there. It is getting increasingly difficult to shed pounds, but I'm almost to my original goal of 160 pounds. Michelle has been instrumental in helping me clean up my diet, so I am not only getting lighter, but *healthier*.  This is important. Restricting caloric intake makes it more difficult to get proper nutrition, but by eliminating all junk calories, I have managed to squeeze more value into 35% fewer calories. I've had a couple people ask me what *I did*. Well, it's pretty easy to lose weight, and there aren't any secrets. Eat healthy foods, in reasonable portions, while maintaining an active lifestyle. I've revised my goal weight a little bit. I think I can get to 155 pounds without getting too silly about it.  
- **Finger** While installing a disc rotor, I sliced my right index finger. It required four stitches and, even two weeks later, is proving to be quite a nuisance. My mobility is still limited and the wound periodically pops open. I'm hoping this rights itself soon so that I can return to normal life. 
- **Riding&amp;Running**: I've been getting back into longer rides. I'm not logging miles this year, or really even tracking my hours, but I'd wager that this is one of my better bike months in a long time. It's been delightful to get out on a road bike and watch the miles tick off so effortlessly. Descending and rough roads have been awkward, and I've had to truncate a couple of longer rides, but I've still produced a solid month for riding. Running has not been progressing as well. I had a solid fourteen mile run shortly after my wisdom teeth, then cut my finger, and struggled somewhat at the Get Lucky Half marathon. My finishing time was 1h54m and some seconds...slightly slower than my Polar Dash time from January. I expected to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 1h45m. I have since shifted focus to building up my endurance for the Minneapolis marathon in June. I'd love to break four hours.
- **Terrible neighbors**: Somewhat anticlimactically, my terrible neighbors moved out. I noticed that it was quiet and smelled much less like stale beer, piss, and cigarettes. Then I discovered that they were *gone*. This is great news for me. I need to make sure that someone more awesome moves in now. Anyone?
