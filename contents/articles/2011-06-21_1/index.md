Our bags were packed and we were ready to go. It was around noon on Friday and we were at the bike shop making final adjustments to Michelle's bike. Due to a number of minor snafus, we had only completed the bike on Wednesday and its first ride would be the first day of a four day bike trip. Oops. Fortunately it wasn't a completely new bike, only heavily modified from its previous configuration. I tinkered with the front derailleur, inflated the tires, checked a few other things and we tentatively continued on our way.

In hindsight, I'm pretty happy with the way that I planned the route, with a few exceptions. One of those was the route that we took out of the Twin Cities. I'd forgotten that late last year I'd discovered a much more pleasant way to get to Hugo via a network of infrequently used paved and gravel roads. The first day was destined to be one of the least interesting, just by nature of having to escape the urban bubble, but I made a couple of navigational choices that put us on roads that weren't particularly pleasant to travel at that time of day. Nonetheless, we made it to Hugo and hopped on the bike path. The weather was quite nice for the first stretch. Sunshine was abundant, the wind was unoffensive, and the temperature was neither too hot or too cold. If the forecast didn't call for rain later in the day, I would have felt quite spoiled.

As we approached Lindstrom the weather started looking more ominous. We stopped and hung out with Vilheim Moberg and refueled.

Just after Center City we turned off of the main road and finally had a chance to revel in quiet.

The final miles into Wild River were nearly traffic-free. We slowed our pace and just took it all in. *I'm just going to lie down in nature.* We got to the park and did exactly that.

I gathered firewood (tsk tsk) while Michelle made a superb dinner of Lentils and onions. I was interested to see her stove in action. She recently upgraded to an MSR Dragonfly. I've used a similar stove, but it didn't have the ability to regulate the heat like the Dragonfly. For more advanced campsite cooking it seemed like a really nice feature. Despite a bit of rain on the way into the park, our evening was pretty much dry. We ate dinner, enjoyed the fire and generally relaxed. This became a theme for the trip: biking, eating, relaxing, and sleeping. As is usually the case, I was a bit ambitious in our planning, thinking that we could complete our days and still have ample time to explore the parks. It didn't quite work out that way, but that's just fine.  
  
We went to bed. It was warm. Storms were gathering.  
  
I woke up at some point during the night to the pre-storm lightning. There were no other sounds from nature. No wind, no thunder, no rain. It would hit soon. I closed the fly and went back to sleep. When the storm hit it was intense. The rain pummeled the tent. Aside from a few drops penetrating the fly and ending up on our faces, the little tent was stalwart in its defiance of the elements. In spite of the bad weather we both slept extremely well and extremely long. This would become another theme of the trip: endurance sleeping.
