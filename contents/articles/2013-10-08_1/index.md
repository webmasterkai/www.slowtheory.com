For a few reasons, I decided to spend the money on a Spot Gen3 tracker for our upcoming hike on the SHT. 

- The idea of dragging Michelle into a potentially dangerous situation without having a reliable way of handling an emergency made me uneasy. I don't *expect* to have an emergency, but no one ever does, and there will be many unknowns, including challenging terrain, extremely limited access to cell coverage, and many hours of hiking by headlamp. Knowing that in the very worst situation, I have "an out" will put me in a much more relaxed and adventurous frame of mind.
- During events like the [Tour Divide](http://www.tourdivide.org), I supremely enjoy following the trackers of race participants. It sounds strange, but watching that orange blip slowly work its ways across the map is exciting! I have set up a tracking page at [http://www.timlupfer.com/spot](http://www.timlupfer.com/spot) where you can follow along at home. While I can appreciate that most people would find this boring, I know there are a few of you out there who will enjoy this.
- I love data. Having access to generalized information about our hiking patterns will help inform future excursions.
- I will not have to feel like an asshole for saying "I can't" or "I don't want to" in response to the ubiquitous, "Call when you get there????" The spot tracker will do it for me!
