day one hundred and twenty-three. it is a thursday. I woke up early this morning because I was done sleeping. I have days like that. my eyes open and in spite of my will or the practical challenges presented by the hour, it is time to start my day. today was such a day. I briefly explained this, kissed you and went home. the melted snow was in the process of crystallizing on the ground in front of me. it shimmered and teased. I delighted in its unabashed playfulness. *beautiful inanimate morning*. the time passed quickly. I listened to the radio and made breakfast. as I sat at my computer devoid of any real purpose, my eyes fell on my change jar. yesterday I found you counting your change. I decided to follow your example, put mine in a bag and bring it to the bank. behind the jar were letters that you've written to me over the past one hundred and twenty-three days, letters meant only for me. one fell to softly to the ground. I picked it up. written on the back side was the word SEX. I read.*..*  
  
*when you're really, really, really really in love for real and no other thing could really express that...and I amsoexcited to share/experience/be all of them FOREVER WITH YOU. *  
  
**I loved this letter. I still love it. it was written on december 3rd. lately I feel like I do not make you as happy as I did then. I wish that I did/do/will. sometimes I stop for a moment, completely disengaged from my immediate surroundings, and simply revel in the excitement of having you in my life. you make me this happy. I enjoy the simple things, the comparative *nothings* of our experience: watching the wall as it slowly reintegrates with the dirt below our feet. I enjoy the relative-monumental: events, moments, weekends, future vacations, contemplation of the serious, indulgence of the childlike, parties, gatherings, holidays, runs, rides, dinners, etc. in short, *I love you*. so tell me, *you*...anything, really. if there are ways that you could be happier, things that we are doing/not doing, your needs as an individual...whatever. I guess I just mean to say that your happiness is important to me and I hope that I am and can continue to be part of its gettin' REALBIG. love, your-wabee.
