For the past few days I've felt *off*. It is difficult to describe, except to say that my mind and body have been in a kind of rebellion. Last Saturday I was supposed to run the Zumbro trail race. I was super excited. The weather was going to be terrible, which is a huge benefit to me in shorter distance races. Beyond the favorable conditions and surprisingly adequate training, I just really needed to spend some time in the woods finding spiritual equilibrium. 

Things went awry, however, when the following circumstances kept me from reaching the starting line: I didn't leave a time buffer (arguably, I didn't even leave enough time if things went perfectly), Michelle wasn't punctual, and one of our roommates left her car parked behind ours. I was bummed, but with The Trail Mix 50km next weekend, I wasn't *overly bummed*. After determining the effort was hopeless, we went in search of breakfast. The Seward Cafe was closed. The Birchwood Cafe was closed. We went home. Fail #2.

I went out later in the day with the intention of running 5 laps of 5.6 miles each. I just wasn't into it and stopped after one lap. My legs felt heavy and the mental blow of running on  familiar paved roads rather than in the unfamiliar forest left me lethargic and unmotivated. Coupled with dreadful weekend weather, I was destined to spend the day doing nothing at all.

Monday was more of the same. Shitty weather. Lack of sunshine. Feeling bad. 

Today, things turned around. The sun came out, I felt connected to the people in my life, and my energy levels took a turn for the better. It felt so good to be outside. My body still feels like it is in a funk, but I've noticed that it often lags behind my temperament. By the weekend, I expect to be normal againâ€¦and normal is going to feel damn fine.
