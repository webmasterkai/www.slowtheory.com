 Woke up a bit ill--sore throat, congested, and foggy eyed--and contemplated not going to the dentist. Eventually I convinced myself that I would regret not going, ventured out into the rain and hopped on my bicycle. The rain was unpleasant and I quickly realized that I would arrive at the office completely soaked. Fortunately I had exhibited enough forethought to pack an extra shirt in my pannier, so I arrived with only the lower half of my body damply clad. I didn't have my normal dentist--if one can have such a thing going to the dentist as infrequently as I do--and was instead greeted by a twenty-six year old slicker named John. He shook my hand vigorously and made no explanation of why I had a different dentist. I later found out that he finished undergrad one year after I would have finished. 

 I found out the following things: my broken wisdom tooth needs to be surgically removed, surgical removals are not covered under medical insurance (even though I don't have medical insurance, it would be easier and more useful to acquire than dental), the broken tooth is now dead, two other wisdom teeth are only partially in and should be removed, a tooth on the opposite side needed a three surface filling, I still need two crowns and a bunch of other work, and I can be very still when I need to be. 

 I left--into the endless rain--with one new tooth, one old tooth that I no longer wanted, an x-ray of my raging infection, a referral to an oral surgeon, and a frown. I wondered how anyone with average income pays for such a thing, or pays for the insurance to prevent such a thing.
