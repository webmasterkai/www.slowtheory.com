1.) 2am. wake up to mousey climbing around my big dummy. *what the hell?* I get up and he quickly jumps out and runs into the kitchen. there's nothing in my big dummy to attract a mouse as far as I can tell.

2.) take the opportunity to urinate. as I'm standing there I see a flash of something bolt across the bathtub. at the time I think that this thing is called a silverfish. after some wikipedia research I find out that these multi- legged abominations are often mistakenly referred to as silverfish, but are in fact nothing more exotic than "centipedes", and that their presence probably indicates the house is teeming with other insect-beasts.

3.) wake up to the german shephard from a house on the next block barking. this is usual. this dog does little else, spending perhaps eight hours out of any given day aggressively and incessantly barking. I cannot imagine what it would be like to live in the houses closer to it. I don't think being tied up in the backyard is really where this particular breed of dog excels.

sigh. less than five weeks now.
