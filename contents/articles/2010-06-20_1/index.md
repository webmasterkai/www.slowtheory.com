When I am grief stricken I tend to channel that energy into physical activities. It's nice because it releases endorphins, bolsters my confidence, saps me of nervous energy, and improves my long term prospects of being slightly less ugly. Mostly though, it takes up time and makes me tired. The simple things. In the past two weeks I have been trying to focus more energy on weight lifting and running. I have been very one dimensional this year, spending most of my activity time cycling. I have certainly seen improved results on the bike, but that's not necessarily my aim. I want to be fit in a more comprehensive sense. I want my body to be capable of a multitude of different tasks. Getting back in the gym I quickly and painfully became aware that cycling is an activity for the legs. Getting back on my feet I learned that my calves don't do a lot while cycling. I need to do more and varied things. This evening I had a fantastic run. I listened to the Misfits and Big Black and felt like I was on top of everything, each footstep stomping problems deeper and deeper into a place where they could not touch me. The sensation passes, of course. It's the body's natural process of narrowing focus. My body has not adapted to the fact that I am pushing it for no other reason than to push my body. It is still convinced in those instances that it is doing something of the utmost importance, something that will determine whether I live or die. In some sense, perhaps it is right.
