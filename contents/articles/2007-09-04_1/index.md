It did not surprise me that I dreamt about her. It's her birthday today, after all. I think about all of the broken promises and how I always, even now, found her beyond reproach. I suspect that she felt the same--a promise expectedly broken of and not by a human being, dictated by circumstances dictated by and not of a spiteful divinity. I was visiting Litchfield. It was the weekend. I was grocery shopping. The store was incredibly busy and in a bizarre show of affection for a former life I started stocking the shelves. She wore a long jacket and watched me from the packaged meats section. It took me a moment to comprehend the inexplicable weight of her eyes following me. I stood up and walked towards her. She did not look away as she fled, mouthing something at me that I could not understand. She did not understand the odds that had been overcome for our chance meeting to occur. We stood facing each other, lips quivering, on the cusp of doing or saying until I woke up. So today I privately celebrate her birthday and in two days time, my own.
