decompress. yesterday began abruptly at 5am and lingered until ending somewhat more gently at 1am. unpleasantness sandwiched itself comfortably into the negative space created by the act of *being awake*. this included two failed sewing projects, mediocre chili, a hostile interaction, physical affliction, the unveiling of different understandings of *now*, and staring at a wall while feeling simultaneously like I was and was not in an empty room. I decided to do my long run on sunday rather than yesterday, so I did not run. I also failed to complete the epic ski trip that I had conceived as an alternative. my life has been awesome lately, so it shouldn't be terribly surprising to me that the self-balancing occurred in a small time frame, or even that the response to the balance of one idea contributed to a domino-like rearrangement of many of my life's other ideas and understandings. even though I understand that it is like a punch to the gut--*short, painful, but generally harmless*--it does not make it any easier to wake up today in a world that seems slightly less familiar. it takes just one person offering one sympathetic glance to feel connected to an entire world of people. yesterday this did not happen.  

I was listening to an episode of radiolab while fail-sewing about memory. the idea was that recollection of a memory equals reconstructing a memory, and that consequently the more remembered a moment the less factually correct it becomes.
