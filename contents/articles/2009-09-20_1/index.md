Almanzo. I debated for a long time whether I would shave off part of my beard as a sacrifice to the dream of a bicycle gang of mustache clad gentleman. I decided that I would. It's hair. It grows back. 100 miles. The mustache. The pugsley. I was going for fun, for amusement, to enjoy the beauty of the gravel road. It's a funny thing. Gravel roads have become increasingly difficult to find. The world is being turned to concrete, to asphalt, to plastic, to surfaces that do not shift and change, becoming new things in an instant so that even the stupid human eye can understand its temperament. I love this idea. The same route as May. The same route I did not finish the last time that I was in Rochester. I had no worries this time around. Fitter? Maybe. Healthier, for sure. But my mind was in the right place. I was going to ride on gravel roads. With friends, quietly observing a beauty that can only be properly understand through space, proportion, dimension. It cannot simply be flattened on to a two dimensional surface and understood. It is that beautiful. It is that temporary.

We left Friday. Afternoon bleeding into evening. I watched from the passenger seat of an automobile as the world drifted by me. Growing increasingly sleepy because automobiles do that to me. Rhythmic. Subatomic self-manipulations lulling me into a kind of transparency, looking through the back side of my hand at the floormat that may or may not have been at my feet, which may or may not have been, period. Reliving. Conceiving. I like this. Special one way glass. We arrived to an almost empty backyard. Chris is one of the most wonderful people I have ever met. Always thoughtful and genuine. There are few people in the world like him. I set up my tent in the same spot that I did in May. The corner of the yard where dew would condense and grubs would gather. This is me. In the dirt, at my own feet, lost in a swirl of images.

I hadn't eaten in several hours. We went to McDonalds (!!), to the grocery store and then to the liquor store. Ironically ironic, I bought a case of PBR. Somehow substantial. We returned to the yard to find that a few more people had gathered there. Chris was showing off some pretty pictures and a short segment of video from the previous race. It was hypnotic. The photos were wonderful. Folding beer cans and making my own amusement. It was approaching midnight. Most everyone had left. In the kitchen. Converse without pause. Fill my water bottles. Think about rehydration and quietly announce that it's time for me to sleep.

I fell asleep quickly and woke up only once during the night. It was a wonderful night for sleeping outside. I slept late. Past 7am. By the time I woke up there were people mingling in the driveway. I grabbed a cup of coffee and a plate of waffles. As bikes began to appear I realized that almost everyone was riding a fast bike. There were quite a few people rolling 700x23-28 slick tires. Huh? During the spring edition of the ride, the race edition, there were a few mountain bikes. The closest thing was a sub twenty pound mamasita with 32mm tires. It seemed likely that the pugsleys would drop out of sight quickly. Oh well. I had directions and a bag full of snacks.

I started writing this post days ago. Right after returning from Rochester. I haven't finished it. I'm not sure that I can. The ride was wonderful. We took it easy from the start. The roads were surprisingly similar to the way that I remembered them. For the first thirty miles Ryan and I rode near the back, with only a handful of riders behind us. Taking it easy, conserving energy, having fun. When we reached Chatfield we were delayed for almost two hours by a flat and a detour for one of the riders. I had a beer, looked at bikes and took pictures of bowling balls. It was hard to take pictures. The charger for my small camera is lost, so I took Beth's SLR. It was impossible to get any shots in action, so all of my photos are from stops. As the ride continued we started riding nearer the front. It seemed that people were getting tired, or we started to realize that Pugsleys could hang in there on a moderately paced one hundred mile ride on gravel. After stopping to check out some neat bluffs just before Spring Valley we regrouped. This time we would mostly hang together in a group. The final forty miles were quite flat and enjoyable. I felt wonderful, like I could do the course a second time if only there was enough daylight. Instead we drank more beers and grilled. That was nice too. It was a fantastic day.
