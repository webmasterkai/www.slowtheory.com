The first time I crashed it was sort of funny. We cut through a new section of trails that were steep and somewhat technical. I flopped over the handlebars rather unexpectedly as I came to a stop on an area that I had calculated as much less steep than it actually was. The second time was a bit less funny as I misjudged a drop, allowed my weight to get too far forward and toppled over the handlebars for a second time. I should say, it was a beautiful day for mountain biking. I caught up to Matt after the second crash. He took one look at me and asked if I had crashed on my face. Yes. I had dirt in between my teeth and there was a tree branch stuck in my handlebars. My poor choice in tires combined with the slightly damp conditions amped up the difficulty of a course where I would have struggled with in ideal conditions. For me though, mountain biking is all about fun--getting away from the automobiles and the ubiquity of steel and mortar. The fallen leaves were beautiful. It's that perfect time of year between the end of summer and the time when too many leaves have fallen.

On the way home I got really tired and thirsty. I had lost my polar water bottle after the first crash, so I was relying on Matt's extra water bottle and one granola bar to sustain me for the three and a half hour ride. After showering I took one of the most amazing naps ever. It was perfect. My damaged skin felt cool and soft against the bed sheets. I slept for almost three hours, reluctant to rejoin the waking world. There was a slight pain at the base of my neck.

In the evening I didn't do anything. I moved the television antenna until I found the optimal positioning for hdtv reception. Then I watched the office. Having lived without television for a couple years it's amazing the bad habits that I've acquired in the past ten months. My mind has become sluggish and I do not create with the same intensity that I once did. The isolation that once charmed and compelled me has become dull space which I fill with meritless endeavours like watching television or reading books that have large print and few ideas.
