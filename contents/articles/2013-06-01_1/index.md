Minor injuries and a forced break from running has allowed me to focus more on important thingsâ€¦like making meaningful changes to our house. Over the winter we were already strongly considering filling in the pond. Spring removal of one of the neighbor's trees, and the resulting potential for creating a garden, helped to expedite/finalize an already inevitable decision: the pond needs to go. After some trial&amp;error, subsequent trips to the google repository, we managed to slowly drain a good portion of the water using [Math](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siphon#Explanation_using_Bernoulli.27s_equation)

Tomorrow might have to inspire greater ingenuity to finish the task.
