Thursday. After many attempts thwarted by rain, the general and I made it to hillside in elk river for some mountain biking. Hillside, as the name would suggest, has a few hills so I opted for a 33x19 gear. Nice and little. The karate monkey handled really well. The big wheels rolled over everything, and aside from losing traction on an uphill log early in the ride, the gear proved adequate for climbing. I could have gone smaller and still been fine as the trail is mostly grinding up hills and sailing down them. Very little flat ground. I might try a 30 or 31 next time. Overall it was a lot of fun. Wirth is sadly closed until the luce line business

is completed, so opportunities for decent mountain biking might be limited.

I'm running twin cities marathon this year. Since deciding to run it two weeks ago I've done only sporadic training. I need to get more serious about it. In the afternoon I went out for an easy six mile run on the cedar lake and up wirth parkway. It was nice. The area where I am living is nearly limitless for good running routes. There's even a few dirt opportunities along the way.
