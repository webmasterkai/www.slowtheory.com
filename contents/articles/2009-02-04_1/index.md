A rather unpleasant part of my job now consists of explaining to salespeople why we don't want to/cannot/would not benefit from buying their products. Although my skill has improved dramatically, I am still not very good at it. Salespeople are clever and armed with insider methods for duping your typically undereducated bicycle shop parts buyer. So in the interest of countering their efforts I have decided to start taking notes on my interactions, highlighting both areas where I excelled and areas where I stood stupefied, as if before the wand of Voldemort. In a rare flurry of pre-spring business there were a couple of complete overhauls on the repair hook, so I was fully invested in the exotic world of a 1980s low end Schwinn touring bike when the three men walked in. Yes, three. They walked briskly towards the shop area, fanning out in a formation undoubtedly designed to identify any other shop personnel. The point man in the triangular formation announced that he and his cohorts hailed from "____ and the ____ group", exhibiting this valuable lesson:

1.) **Speak loudly so as to exude confidence.**


Later, asking the a-train of his first impression he remarked that, "I thought they were solicitors for sure...like they were selling phone books or advertising." As for me, I was entranced by the bottom bracket lug on the Schwinn Voyager and could scarcely muster a thought before they were on top of us. I saw them flipping through our sunglasses and figured it would be best to bring the interaction to an end quickly. "Hey guys," I began, "we don't really plan on doing much business with ____ this year." After saying this I was left with another valuable salesmanship lesson:

2.) **Pretend like the person you're talking to isn't sure of anything...you know, like they're a depressed teenager mulling over suicide.**

"Oh, why? What have you replaced it with?" By this time the bottom bracket lug was no longer affecting my faculties of sense and reason and I was able to measure my response rather well. I attempted to avoid topics which they would be inclined to refute such as, "Your products are terrible." I explained that the number of products that we were attempting to carry was disproportionate to the size of our shop, and that we simply needed to cut some vendors. I was diplomatic. At this point they demonstrated another brilliant tactic:

3.) **When you don't like what you hear, talk to someone else.**

At this point they diverted their attention to the a-train and I returned to the enchanting Schwinn Voyager. Later the he would remark on the worsening situation by saying, "Basically from the first minute I was trying to figure out how to get out. I batted my eyes at you a couple of times hoping that you might come and rescue me." Of course, I did not. I used the glistening teal paint of the Schwinn Voyager as my shield, feigning such interest in it that no one would dare distract me. It was the first time I had tried the technique and it worked amazingly well. The conversation with the a-train continued. He was lured in by this clever tactic:

4.) **Act interested in constructively critical comments so as to provide the opportunity to assuage the anxiety of the speaker with sedate head nodding, while also providing the pretext for promoting new products**

This relies on:

5.) **Pretending like all new things are better.**

So it went like this: the a-train explained a problem with a warranty item while one nodded his condolences, another tried to sell him a different product (it was presumably better because it was different), and the third talked about something completely different. What? Why a third speaker talking about something different? This is why:

6.) **Create confusing noises so as to weaken defenses.**


It's a trick that has been used in military standoffs. For example the associated press reports: "In Fallujah's darkened, empty streets, U.S. troops blast AC/DC's Hell's Bells and other rock music full volume from a huge speaker, hoping to grate on the nerves of this Sunni Muslim city's gunmen and give a laugh to marines along the front line." The extra man also served as optical dissonance, skittishly moving around the store, ducking in and out of displays, touching things, and asking customers if they needed assistance.

Despite their best efforts, it went nowhere. By hiding in the office I created a situation where the a-train had to attend to a customer and was able to excuse himself from the conversation. I learned a lot. Part of our victory was achieved by their unfamiliarity with the products they were selling. For example, the a-train asked why a headlight bracket was canted. After explaining that it was not canted, realizing that it was in fact canted, the salesperson then realized that it was not a headlight bracket at all. It was, in fact, a taillight bracket. One thing is for sure: they will be back and they will have new tricks.
