**Weather conditions: **beautiful. temperatures in the low twenties with lots of sunshine. snow in places, but overall quite lovely.  
**Distance: **~12 miles  
**Time: **~2 hours including stops    
**Notes:** rode my bike over to michelle's. her plan was a fifteen mile run, so it worked out well for me just to stop at my apartment while she continued home. the bitter cold and a sore groin from slipping on the ice *while walking* have limited my running in the past two weeks. thursday I managed seven and friday I ran on the treadmill in my vibram fivefingers. today I felt great. still a bit of groin soreness when running downhill, and my calves were sore, but everything loosened up and I had a great run. michelle is a faster runner than me, so we completed this run in about the same time that it took me to do my ten mile run two weeks ago. overall, it was awesome. I felt great, the weather was beautiful, and I got to run with michelle. no complaints.
