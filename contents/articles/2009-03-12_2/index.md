In the past couple of weeks it seems that internet bikes and products have been the buzz with customers at the shop. Last week a guy came with with a paired spoke wheel that had a solid 3/8"x26tpi axle. "Hey, I got this trainer on nashbar and I can't use it without a quick release. Can you make this a quick release?" 'Sure, but this is an unusual axle size to convert to quick release, so I'll have to order it for you. Is that okay?' Yes. Nod. Etc. 'The part should be in on Tuesday and we'll be sure to get it done promptly.' Groan. Wriggle. Tuesday? I mean, it was late Friday afternoon. It's understandable that he expected us to airfreight-Saturday-deliver his $17.99 part. Fast-forward: Tuesday. Twenty minutes after UPS showed up he was on the telephone: "Is my wheel done yet?" 'Not yet, but I'll have it done shortly and give you a call.' I dropped what I was doing, fixed his wheel, and called him back. 2:20pm. "Okay, I'll be in for it around 4pm." 'Very good, we're open until 8pm. Thank you for your business.' The rest of the day passed and I did not see nashbar-trainer-guy. He needed his wheel urgently, so I was surprised and a bit concerned. The next morning he wandered into the shop with what I will assume was his son. The son veered off to look at clothing while we settled the wheel business. While we are completing the transaction he yells across the store, "NASHBAR is having a sale on shorts. We'll just order some from there!" He then proceeds to insinuate that I overcharged him. $17.99 plus labor. Save the rest for the internet.

Why? Throughout the week there were at least four other customers (that is a large number for March in Minnesota) that came in and said, "I've been looking at X bike online for Y dollars. What do you have that is similar?" I give those customers credit because at least they were willing to give us a chance. We were able to accommodate two of those potential customers, but it required sacrifices in both prices and products that made for somewhat questionable sales. Part of the problem seems to be that our time is not perceived as holding value. Internet customers expect that they can use us like a library, farming information and asking for help when they get to something tricky. Unfortunately the other part of the problem is that bicycle companies have put us in a position where it is very difficult to compete. Let's compare.

## 2009 Giant Defy 1 versus 2009 Windsor Fens

I chose these two bikes because I think it's one of the biggest holes we have in our line this year: a decent road bike below $1000. The Windsor is $799.99 with free shipping. After sales tax the Giant would be $1494.50.


- **Frameset**: ALUXX SL-Grade Aluminum versus Engineered, Precision welded Heat treated aluminum main tubes and rear stays. Both bikes have carbon forks with aluminum steerers. *I'll give giant the edge here, and I'll even exaggerate the difference by calling it a $150 difference in  frame and fork.*
- **Handlebars/stem**: Giant Alloy 31.8 versus Ritchey Comp. *The Windsor takes it here. Minus $50.*
- **Seatpost**: Giant versus FSA. *We'll call this one even.*
- **Saddle**: Giant verus "Racing with color accent panels". *Uhhh...I'll give this one to Giant even though their saddles are nothing special. Plus $25.*
- **Pedals**: Crankbrother smarty versus SPD rip-off. *Plus $10.*
- **Shifters/Derailleurs/Cassette/Chain**: 2009 105 10 speed. *Same.*
- **Brakes**: 105 versus Tektro R530. *Plus $70.*
- **Crankset**: FSA Gossamer versus FSA Vero. *Plus $70 (including bottom bracket difference).*
- **Wheelset**: Generic hubs with CXP22 rims versus DA22 rims. *Plus $60.*

The difference then in parts (even being favorable to Giant) is $275. That means that 1.) we have to establish the superiority of somewhat elusive technology (ALUXX SL-Grade aluminum...outboard bearing crankset...etc), and 2.) after successfully doing that we have to offer another $420 of value, or 30% of the cost of the bike. Okay, so let's say that they'd pay for assembly and two years worth of service. That's about $200. Now the fit. $50 for a computer fit. That means that even after convincing our customer of the value of the bike and our tangible service, we have to convince them that the intangible benefits of a bike shop are worth $170 or 11% of their purchase price. Perhaps true, but still a difficult argument to make.

Giant is enormous. Right? They make bikes for everyone and have no qualms about saying so. Perhaps they even make the Windsor bikes in some dark, damp corner of their Chinese factories. Wouldn't you think they could afford to be just a little bit more competitive with online retailers? Or at least that their heavy handed influence on the Chinese assembly lines would be able to raise the prices of the internet bikes? It's frustrating. Long term, it's not sustainable. In an industry with a very slim profit margin, having to discount bikes even 5% can mean the difference between making money and losing money.
