Strava tells me that I've logged 310 miles in my current pair of Altra Instincts. In addition to those miles, I've added perhaps 100-150 between *life* and *unrecorded running*, for a total of 400-450 miles. That's very near the typical middle of the life of a pair of shoes for me, so it's time for a review.

There is a trend in the running shoe industry towards minimalism. A while back, some intelligent people realized that we've been doing it *increasingly wrong* over the past couple decades. Rigid shoes with arch support and a substantial drop from heel to forefoot have resulted in poor running form and a greater likelihood of injury. On paper, Altra's strengths are: zero drop, a wide toe box, and moderate cushioning.

I bought my first pair of Instincts last summer, but didn't get around to using them extensively until after the Superior Trail marathon. Once committed to the concept, I adapted quickly to taking shorter strides, landing softly on my midfoot, and increasing my cadence. The basic tenets of healthy cycling proved relevant to running. I was able to recover from my knee injury and these became my favorite shoes.  

###Pros

- *Wide* toe box. This was a very attractive feature for me, as my wider-than-average feet are typically rolled up like immobile burritos in conventional running shoes. In the Instinct, my toes were able to spread out and my feet encouraged to do the thing at which they excel.
- *Moderate* amount of cushioning. The 22mm stack height hit the sweet spot for me. Many of the super-minimalist shoes are too extreme for my needs. About ten years, I shattered one of the sesamoid bones in my right foot. It didn't heal, and never will, so a bit more shoe is a nice thing for longer runs. 22mm seems to offer a nice combination of flexibility and padding for longer distance runs, while not compromising the philosophy of an uninhibited stride&amp;strike
- *Insole adjustable*. The shoes came with two insole options. The shoe can also be used without an insole, which means you have three options.
- *Durable*. With a minor exception (noted below), they are in pretty good shape for a shoe that has over 400 miles on it. 
- *Versatility*. While the tread is very obviously intended for road running, I used these shoes at the Murphy 25k trail run and did not feel that they were a liability. I also saw a couple people running in them at the Moose Mountain Marathon. The flexible sole, low'ish stack height, and ability to engage the muscles of the feet make it possible to navigate terrain that I wouldn't normally expect from a road shoe.  

###Cons

- Stitching is coming undone at the same spot on both shoes.
- Had to buy 1/2 size larger than my typical size.

###More photos

As seen here, they are in pretty decent shape for a shoe with 400+ miles on it, but do have a couple of weak areas.

###Next

I've purchased another pair of Instincts that I am beginning to work into the rotation, but Altra has since come out with a trail running shoe that is more like the Instinct. Their original trail shoe--the Lone Peak--I found to be rigid and restrictive. The Superior has a removable rock guard, and offers more of the features and fit of the Instinct. Initial impressions are quite good.
