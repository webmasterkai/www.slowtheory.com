the first snow. I always think that I like winter more when it's not winter, so I was a little bit disappointed to re-learn that many things about riding home from work in the snow actually suck. the snow was like sugar. very dry, fine and shifty. the pugsley mostly worked well, but the front wheel did want to wash out a couple of times. I broke another spoke on the rear wheel, the second in the past week. I built the wheel with wheelsmith spokes. normally I use only dt swiss, but since it was a fat bike I didn't think it would matter. wrong choice. I'll have to rebuild it tomorrow.
