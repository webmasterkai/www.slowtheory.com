I often find myself trolling missed connections on craigslist. It represents a bizarre voice of the collective unconscious--loneliness, desperation, anxiety...all of the secret things that the actionless strangers I see everyday have stowed casually, caustically in their primitive psyches. Voyeurism (click LIKE). In any case, since craigslist does not have a LIKE button, I have decided to start highlighting posts that entertain, enlighten, offend, enliven, arouse, or whatever. Here is the first in what will certainly be an epic series:

> To the guy that crapped in my car. (SW Minneapolis)

> We met on Craigslist so I am hoping that this post finds you. I know that it could quite possibly be the most humiliating first date that you have ever been on, but I am willing to look past that.

> I thought we had chemistry sitting at Famous Daves sharing the feast for two while drinking their sweetened ice tea. I really felt like there was a connection there. I found you to be intelligent and witty and looked forward to further conversation with you.

> At some point in life, everyone has gambled on a fart and lost. It just happened to be on a first date in the passenger seat of my car. Please don't feel bad. The package I sent you with Pepto the next day and the note that said "First dates are always a crap shoot. Call me" was meant to be funny, not offensive.

> I have gambled on a fart and lost on multiple occasions. I probably win 95% of the time, but I don't think anyone wins 100% of the time. That's why they call it "gambling". I'm the last person to judge you for crapping your pants. In fact, I am impressed by your boldness. The timing on the other hand, could have been a tad bit better...like when you're not sitting on a heated leather seat...

> What I am trying to say is that if you want to go out again, I would be more than happy to take you someplace where we can get a meal that is high in fiber and less taxing on the digestive tract.

> I await your call or email,
