the past two days have been thrilling, faces mirrored and reflected off of a glass of imagination, begging to be this new and known. ...but no. it canâ€™t be. ...it is bearded with a two inch scar above and to the left of its trembling brow. ...or it is only the cherublike face of a child or the dull, sunken and listless scowl of dispassion that could never have joined "hurts" with "fuck". somewhere my name is etched out of fake letters to a graph of what it means to converse in real letters with fake names. i wake up early to watch the sun rise from my bicycle. away to work, from one measured dream to the next. the world is silent and the streets thick with a foggy reminiscence of the night before, when angels with wings sprouted from puppeteer strings and devils with trousers bursting from their zippers played their macabre game of pantomimed motions of sincerity. ...and now you know something about this strangled anonymous letter writer. details dripped from the curiosity of answering personal ads with terrible screams from behind the mask of an ordinary, everyday passenger, passively pedestrian. would this hobby frighten or transfix? when i go to the grocery store i give them a fake name. i wonder about replies and speech patterns. epoxy.

a story.
