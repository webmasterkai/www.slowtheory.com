I slumped into the passenger's seat, in charge of proper ordering of Radiolab episodes and not sleep-injuring myself. No coffee. Quiet morning. Fearlessly anticipating blue skies, breakfast, and the unimaginable freedom from machination. I devoted myself to not knowing the time, enduring the morning piss-amble, and wholeheartedly committing myself to the course of life-action determined least insensible in *congress* with wilderness. 

From my dreamy, blissful slumber--though waking and staring straight-ahead--I was roused by the sound of a thing coiling, twisting, and devouring itself amidst the sea of oil slicked churning, heaving insane metals that so effortlessly propelled us forward. Whew. Thought simplification. Try again: a thing made a series of noises underneath my side of the automobile. Despite my general incoherence at the time, I was alert enough to realize that prior to its pronouncement of distress, nothing was out of the ordinary. No. A sea of concrete.

"What was that?" Michelle asked.

"Uhhh…I don't know," I mumbled.

"Did I hit something?"

"No."

"Should we go back?"

"I think we should."

As she pulled over to turn around, the consequence of the problem became apparent: power steering was gone. I am well versed in automobiles enough to know that belts control things and that sometimes they break. Michelle is alert enough to warning lights, symbols, and other notifications to notice that the battery light had illuminated. The result? I knew something was wrong with the alternator.

We limped the rest of the way to Grand Marais and slowly began absorbing our options. This continued as we ate a liberal, northern Minnesota diner breakfast. Good eating habits were abandoned for VACATION, so a breakfast of potatoes, eggs, and other grossness was perfectly acceptable. We called various auto repair places, getting nowhere until we talked to the VW dealer in Duluth. After some coaxing, they told us they had the part.

On a whim, we detoured to a small auto repair place with a police car and a pink derby car sitting in front of it. A handwritten note on the door said, "Mike [phone number]". A guy emerged from the garage.

"Uhhh…are you Mike?" someone finally asked.

He glanced at the embroidered *Mike* on his jacket. "Yeah."

We explained our plight. He looked at the car and told us that the belt wasn't just gone, but that the pulley tensioner was gone. The shop in Duluth didn't have one of these. We were out of options.

Like anyone faced with a difficult decision should do, we ran across the street to have a beer and finalize the plan. I wasn't entirely comfortable with the plan that had emerged of leaving things as they were, trying to drive the car back to Duluth, and figuring it out there (potentially extending our stay indefinitely). After *further* consideration, we revised the plan: leave the car with Mike, get a ride back to the Twin Cities on Monday, and pick up the car another weekend.

We were now free to return to vacation. However, we needed to shuttle the canoes to the entry point, so we would spend the next three hours tackling more logistical challenges.

While waiting for Justin and Michelle to return with the other canoe, Murray and I defended our food from this little guy.

When they finally returned, we packed our things and were finally in the water.

The portage leaving Poplar Lake.

We entered our first lake without motors.

The sun came out and would stay out for the remainder of the trip.

We made a fire and prepared hobo dinners.

And that was the end of day two!

To be continued...
