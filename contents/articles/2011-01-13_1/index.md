I've decided to start keeping a more detailed running log for my hilo preparation.  
  
**Weather conditions**: 11F at the start with light snow. ~1" of fresh, dry snow on the ground  
**Distance**: 10 miles  
**Time**: ~2hrs including stops  
**Notes:** After warming up I felt great. Because of the fresh snow on the ground I took a very slow pace to ensure that I'd be able to comfortably complete the distance. I had to remind myself that running in January in Minnesota will be different than running in March in Hawaii. Once my body honed in on the pace that I intended to keep I felt absolutely marvelous. I stayed relatively warm and dry. I made the following two changes from my previous long run: a dab of petroleum jelly on my nose and frequent arm circles. The latter looks a bit silly, but my hands tend to get cold when they just dangle in front of me. My nose also gets cold in the wind, but I hate wearing anything over my face, as it just accumulates moisture and makes it difficult to breathe. Both solutions worked out very well. Additionally, my legs felt *great*. After a horrible run last week it is difficult to even describe how wonderful it felt to go out and finish a 10 mile run feeling fresh and confident.
