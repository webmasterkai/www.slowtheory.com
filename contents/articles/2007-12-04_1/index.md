 apparently retrojected a clammy, calming disinterest on the former events of said life: oh, oh baby I surely won't forget. wild strawberries...hmmm...friday evening? and I'm sure that it was, though I don't recall it except in a disarming nothingness, an event not contrary to going to the bathroom or brushing teeth. What's your mailing address? goodnight, sweet prince...frightfully shrill roused from slumber confused and reacquainted with the senselessness of Armitron daybreak. it was the best dialogue--read and recognized, though remembered differently on each behalf. 

 the something of my waking dreams. 

 never close enough, as if all that's wanted is the sight and sound and proximity to death. I just made a get well card for some old guy in georgia that is in a hospital. I am going to send it even though he does not know me. Today at work i bought a clearance book with pictures of scary children. 

 We are having a handlebar mustache growing competition. I look ridiculous. 

 I found a dead pigeon last night next to a statue of a naked man crawling through a hoop. 

 what the fuck was I talking about? not knowing how the fuck to write a letter that didn't involve some recollection of a god peeking devilishly around the corner, so this letter instead: A linear contrast of the obscene wiggles through a hole in the place where life's events (met with reason) find that what began afresh in the womb of investment soon became something altogether unfamiliar--an act so muted in its reservation that it became more of a myth of heresy than anything else, and for that sincere moment of faith it became something entirely SOULFUL. Where once there stood the silhouette of a man at the end of a pier looking out on the sun setting across still waters, there is now the foggy residue of an empty pier and night transitioning awkwardly into morning light--an ambiance reflected without a single source, without a single reflective quality. So here the lump in my throat tells me that I pivot. I pivot through the years in a macabre motion with the jangling bones of a skeleton--the reformation has taken my skin. It's learned, in the moment where fear inspires one to act against fear. In that particular way we are all prophets (the tingling sensation of a severed limb), artificial helloes, and impossible goodbyes. I watch a sparrow struggle against the gusting wind and I know, at once. I simply know. 

 it is not at all that it cannot be remembered.
