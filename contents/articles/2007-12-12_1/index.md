The confessions of Fausto Maijstral begin: 

> "It takes, unhappily, no more than a desk and writing supplies to turn any room into a confessional. This may have nothing to do with the acts we have committed, or the humours we do go in and out of. It may be only the room­--a cube ­having no persuasive powers of its own. The room simply is. To occupy it, and find a metaphor there for memory, is our own fault." 

He goes on to describe the room, before saying: 

> "Why? Why use the room as introduction to an apologia? Because the room, though windowless and cold at night, is a hothouse. Because the room is the past, though it has no history of its own. Because, as the physical being-there of a bed or horizontal plane determines what we call love; as a high place must exist before God's word can come to a flock and any sort of religion begin; so must there be a room, sealed against the present, before we can make any attempt to deal with the past." (285) 

After reading this I immediately rearranged my room. I moved my writing desk a few feet to the left, my computer desk across the room and instituted a fantasy of a reading chair in the corner formerly occupied by the writing desk. The wall in front of my computer desk is noticeably bare with only a few smudges from hands or bodies rubbing against it to mutiny against the endless blandscape of perniciously delivered masking tape walls. Already I feel spatial liberties that meant nothing to me in its previous configuration, as if the air itself has shifted around me and once again inhales fresh and clean. I have managed a temporary paralysis of placement, furthered by the unfulfilled vision of a chair occupying the corner next to the window. 

For hours, perhaps days, I will enter this gelid landscape and cease creating metaphors, live purely a biologically confused state of discerning my surroundings. Instinctively looking, smelling, calculating my best means for survival, even though I realize without doubt or passion that it is inescapable that life will continue as it primarily has, my mind will function to withhold the present tense and cloud up in a fog or incapably projected memories. Last night I awoke from a dream and tried to remember the dialogue that I had been partaking in with a dream stranger. It was beautiful. The words flowed eloquently with a genuine sense of purpose and idea. It was not merely a demonstration of existence: the histrionics of a speaker, a voice without a consciousness, as I have so often felt lately­--a disembodied but brazenly emboldened pulp of things owned by other people. One of the state mottoes for South Carolina is "animis opibusque parati". Last night I watched Mean Streets and had difficulty sleeping.
