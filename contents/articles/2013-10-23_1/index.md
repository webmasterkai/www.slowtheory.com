__*[ I'll post more about the wedding once I have photos from Jeff and A-train. In short: it was an awesome experience that brought together old and new friends/family for something pretty amazing. ]*__

We were both tired, and the *vacation* hadn't even started yet. The next day, we were supposed to wake up early, leave the comfort of our rented cabin, and begin hiking south from near the Canadian border. That plan soon changed. Rather than wake up before sunrise, we decided to sleep in, spend a relaxing day in Grand Marais, find Michelle a puffy coat, eat a delicious lunch at the Angry Trout Cafe, and begin our hike one day south at Judge C.R. Magney state park. I had a very brief pang of regret that we would compromise the plan before we'd even hit the trail, but that soon faded as we indulged in some much needed frivolity, fun, and relaxation. Kai spent both Sunday and Monday with us, kindly serving as our driver to the start of our hike. The modified plan rewarded him with a more interesting experience--we found a secret beach, skipped stones, took pictures with our wedding cake at Palisade Head, ate dinner with Michelle's family, played "poop smoothie", went to sleep, woke up, ate breakfast, drove to Grand Marais, ate lunch, went shopping, walked around, and finally drove to the State Park in the early afternoon. It was a great couple of days during which we slowly began recuperating from an intense couple months going into the wedding. However, the lack of sleep and poor eating had taken its toll--I was getting sick.

After setting up camp, Kai began his long drive home. After bidding him safe travels, we decided to hike to Devil Kettle Falls, one of the more dramatic features on the section of trail that we had skipped and only a short journey from our campsite. We took our time getting there, enjoying the kaleidoscope of unexpected color covering the ground in front of us. Even with the perpetually dull, gray sky, I was happy to find so much exuberance in our landscape. Spirits were high, bodies were moving fluidly, and we were both looking forward to beginning our journey to Duluth the following day.

Curly Jeff had provided us with a week's supply of delicious, dehydrated Vegan meals as a wedding gift. We continued our lavish and indulgent eating habits by making our first trail meal for dinner. Shortly after this, it started to rain...innocently at first, so that we didn't even do anything about it. Eventually, we conceded that it was the real deal, and took our cribbage game under our shelter--a Cooke Custom Sewing 10'x10' tarp. We had zero experience using it as a standalone shelter, but quickly discovered that it did a fine job of both keeping us dry and offering ample space to play games and wait out the rain. The cold soon forced us into our sleeping bags and it was lights out before 9pm. The combination of going to bed early, and the continuous rain made the night seem very long. I checked the clock occasionally, hoping that the sun would come up soon and we'd be able to start hiking south. After 11 hours, it did. Miraculously, the rain even paused while we packed up our things and ate breakfast.

Just as we were leaving the State Park, it started raining again. "It never rains for very long this time of year," I had told Kai the previous day when he'd questioned our rain plan. Despite this apparent evidence to the contrary, it remained my outlook for at least another four hours. We swooshed along in our rain gear, appreciating the simple and unadorned type of landscape. I found the trail to be decidedly different from the portions of the trail with which I was familiar--it did not ascend and descend sharply, nor were there jarring transitions between distinctly different micro-environments. Still, it was pretty in its own subdued way. "Where are my glasses?" I asked forty-five minutes into our travels south. *Shit*. I hung them on the ridgeline of the tarp. When Michelle had taken the shelter down, she hadn't noticed the oddly placed item. I thought about it. We were already starting late, and with the one and a half hour detour, we would be looking at a twelve hour day. On a sunny day, I would have considered it. In the rain, *no way*. I rationalized it like this: my last eye exam was in 2009, and those glasses were so scratched I could barely see through them. My vision isn't that bad--in fact, I rarely where my glasses during running events--so the prospect of going without glasses for a couple weeks was not overly daunting.

We kept moving. The rain continued as we crossed highway 61 and began hiking the only portion of the trail that is on the lake side of the highway. It was spectacular. Waves crashed resoundingly against the molten surface at our feet, leaving only a sliver of trail on which we were able to navigate the shoreline. We slogged through sand, danced across boulders, and inched our way forward. Shortly after crossing back to the woods, we made our planned lunch stop. We'd covered ten miles and it had taken us nearly five hours. This was ominous, as the terrain (aside from the mile and a half along the lake) was among the easiest I've seen on any section of the trail. During our trip preparation, I was resolute in my conviction that running shoes and wool socks would suffice, even if it rained continuously for days. This was not an untested theory. Earlier in the year I spent ten hours running on the same trails with the same gear, in similar conditions. Near the end of that run I was so unconcerned with anything other than finishing that I didn't even attempt to avoid the deep pools of water that had formed on the trail, nearly losing my shoes to the suction of the quicksand mud. On that day, my feet were unbothered. However, on this day, peeling my socks off at lunchtime revealed unsettling puffy skin that had started to fold over on itself, forming alarming trenches on the bottoms of my feet. I changed socks and hoped for the best.

Lunch was a turning point. The rain intensified and our pace slowed. Rather than bolstering our spirits, it highlighted just how much we were done with the day. After six hours, around mile twelve, we crossed an ATV/Snowmobile trail. We discussed the possibility of a *do-over*--try to get to Grand Marais, spend the night at a motel, and start fresh the following day. If we walked to Grand Marais via the trail, it would be another twelve miles. However, the unmarked trail promised a quick stroll to Highway 61. Here, we'd either have a more direct route into town or possibly be able to catch a ride with a passing vehicle.

We scrambled down the ATV trail, found the highway, and took shelter under the porch of a house that was for sale. The map suggested an 8 mile walk to town. At pavement speeds, I thought we could make it in 2.5 hours. We started walking, awkwardly practicing our hitchhiking skills as we went. After some practice, we determined that stopping, facing traffic, and committing to trying to get a ride was a better approach that flippantly waving a thumb. It wasn't long before an SUV stopped for us. Inside, we found a typical northwoods husband and wife--very nice, accommodating, and concerned, but extremely quiet. I struggled to get a read on them until he asked, "Do you two drink coffee?" They brought us to the Java Moose, bought us coffee, and bid us happy travels. It was a touching display of human decency.

After finishing our coffee, we found a room, started drying our gear, cleaned up, and set off to [Stone Harbor Wilderness Supply](http://www.stoneharborws.com/) to replace Michelle's lost gloves, explore footwear options, and grab a couple of things that we'd forgotten. The staff and store were quite impressive, especially given the small town, off-season nature of our visit. Our experiences were extremely positive. I explained that I was looking for a waterproof boot that had a wide toe box, was flexible without excessive arch support, and generally was more "shoe-like" than "boot-like". Jan produced just the product with the [Trekstra Evolution mid GTX](http://www.trekstausa.com/p-31-mens-evolution-mid-gtx.aspx).

After shopping, we had pizza for dinner, went back to the motel, and enjoyed spending a warm, dry night in Grand Marais.
