There is a ladder outside of one of our living room windows. This means that at some point someone either has or will climb past/into/around my window.

What does it mean? Do I like it?


It has been a long time since I have written a blog. My mind has been elsewhere. I am utterly exhausted. Mentally, physically and emotionally drained. We have been packrafting.

And camping.

And cycling.

Occasionally relaxing.

Cutting my hair.

And slowly going insane.
