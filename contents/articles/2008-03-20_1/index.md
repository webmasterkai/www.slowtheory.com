I entered the post office expecting long lines and at least one person haphazardly trying to get a passport. It seems that every time I go to the post office these are the circumstances, but today was different. There was no line at all and no one at the counter. I waited for a minute or so and finally someone appeared. Strange, I thought, it's not my usual lady. I've benefited from her wisdom and efficiency many times over the past five years. Even during the time when I was forced elsewhere by unfortunate geographic circumstances, I thought of her often. I left with mixed emotions. The grocery store was extraordinarily busy. I ended up buying a lot of different things simply because I was forced to stand by them for such a length of time as to develop a strange bond with them. I bought just enough food to try out the new Banjo Brothers saddlebags that I put on the front rack of the xtracycle. After loading everything and turning the handlebars I was sure that I was in for a magnificent face-plant. The wheel seemed to flop in either direction, unnaturally propelled by my inability to load things evenly. However, once I made it out of the parking lot and reached a decent speed it seemed to handle exceptionally well, perhaps better than it would have with everything loaded on the back. Overall, I was quite pleased. The bags were a bit floppy, but that was part of what attracted me to themÂ­they were relatively lightweight and perfect for the types of things that I would want to put on a front rack. I definitely would not want to use them on a rear rack where I'd be more likely to put heavy things.
