it was an impromptu thing. after looking at the forecast for sunday (freezing rain/drizzle) I was compelled to do absolutely nothing. I probably would have embarked on an overly ambitious sewing project that would have ended in frustration. instead, bryce messaged me late saturday night and asked if I wanted to ride the river bottoms. *thinkthink.* at first I was inclined to say *no*, but then I realized that I didn't have a reason other than I hate cold rain. I quickly determined that that wasn't a good enough reason and said, *sure*. I didn't expect the ride to be long, so I opted for a small pancake and a cup of coffee for breakfast. I threw some cranberries, carob squares and a liter and a half of water in my frame bag and went on my way. I considered this being *overprepared*. we crossed the mendota bridge and were quickly dropped into the faux wilderness. it's the sort of ride that I've missed lately. the old trio has somewhat disbanded due to injury and changes in hobbies/priorities. I often lack the motivation to embark on the meandering adventure rides without the promise of camaraderie, despite the fact that on that rare occasion that I do venture out on such a journey alone I find myself wholeheartedly satisfied (see. thirtieth birthday gravel century). anyway, we took the secret dirt road/trail/thingabob from mendota to 77.

all of the trees were marked clearly from the spring flooding. you can see in the picture exactly the point at which the water crested. the same thing will most assuredly not be happening next spring. there was little snow and a cyclocross bike would have been appropriate for much of the ride. nonetheless, we were riding snowbikes. bryce bought his earlier this year and, like many who have recently invested in big wheels, has been disappointed that winter has not afforded many opportunities for properly utilizing the behemoth. the best he had done prior to sunday was to bring it on our december road ride, which was not fun at all.  
  
after crossing 77 we entered the singletrack. it was peaceful.

we just kept riding. the hours passed.

neither of us had expected the ride to be particularly long, so between us we had 70 ounces of water, a couple chocolate bars, cranberries and carob squares. by the time we reached the furthest point on the trail bryce was out of water and the hose on my hydration bladder was frozen. I still wasn't terribly concerned as I didn't fully grasp that we'd been riding for three hours. I mean...I looked at the time and knew that it was a fact, but I expected the return trip to pass as quickly.  
  
it didn't. we both started to get tired and very hungry. just as we were at a low point we had the simultaneous good fortune of finally meeting up with kai (with whom I'd been exchanging phone calls that went like this...you're *where??? next to what??? I don't know where that is...*) and michelle sent a text offering all of us soup after the ride. suddenly things were better. I ate a piece of chocolate and felt like I could ride for another five hours, but the prospect of soup was too exciting to test that theory. we pointed our bikes towards home.
