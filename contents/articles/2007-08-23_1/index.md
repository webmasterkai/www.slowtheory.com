The fog this morning is spooky. The earth is damp and nothing moves. Two nights ago my head touched the pillow and seized in disgust at its perpetual wetness. I switched pillows. Outside no one scurries around in the haze. No faltering, fake, impertinent hellos. My allergies have started to bother me. I walk around glass eyed and sniffling, dragging my head and my knuckles. I haven't been riding my bicycles as much this month. The ceaseless rain and marathon preparation will yield the fewest miles ridden since February. 
 
Someone named Abraham read my copy of Tess of the d'Urbervilles before me. He took infrequent and nearly illegible notes and marked an alarming number of pages. Some of his notes are interesting--Â­for instance, on page sixty he underlined the word ivy and in the margin left a single exclamation point. He was not familiar with the Jacobean era and seemed almost obsessed with finding references to the Bible (just flipping the pages I count the lone word "Bible" scrawled in the right margin at least four times). He marked this passage: 

> "Almost at a leap Tess thus changed from simple girl to complex woman. Symbols of reflectiveness passed into her face, and a note of tragedy at times into her voice. Her eyes grew larger and more eloquent. She became what would have been called a fine creature; her aspect was fair and arresting; her soul whtat of a woman whom the turbulent experiences of the last year or two had quite failed to demoralize. But for the world's opinion those experiences would have been simply a liberal education." (Hardy 103) 

..making special note of the word *reflectiveness*. 

I like reading books that other people have read. Some people complain that heavily marked books taint the authenticity of the reading experience. I think that's bullshit, or possibly true but irrelevant. If nothing else it is hyperbolically overstated. Certainly, it is apparent that aside from a few interesting notes Abraham was reading Tess of the d'Urbervilles for a class, paying careful attention to themes like gender, class and religion. He carefully inventoried each particular so that he could croon most triumphantly of his ultra-sensitive reading of a piece of literature both for its historical and contemporary interpretation. I made the same kinds of notes in all of the books that I read in college. I comprised papers that subsisted merely on strings of quotes pasted together like cotton balls on construction paper. It's what academics look for in an individual. It's the proof by which a young person validates his or her viability in the global marketplace. Abraham faded in the last one hundred pages of the novel, taking ever fewer notes and flapping even fewer pages. I suspect that he did not enjoy the book as much as I am enjoying it, that his ears were perhaps deaf to Hardy's immense poetry. It is interesting though, to experience the same text in a completely different way, to share the experience with a stranger disconnected by time and space.
