Day one I struggled. The heat was relentless and the wind unceasing. I was out on the plains, headed north. I could see way too far off in the distance. It crept ever nearer, but not near enough. I miscalculated by at least fifteen miles. Weary, I called it a day only after eating a blizzard and swapping campsite for motel room. Day two was fucking rad. The wind went away and I traded in cars and trucks for deer and muskrats. I made excellent time. To ease the boredom of so many hours alone, I periodically reset virtual jeff, racing him until I fell too far behind and then resetting him. This went on until the final 26.4 mile stretch, over which the glorious downhill and his slight detour gave me the win for that isolated segment. Overall, he still beat me by over two and a half hours ride time, making no mention of the fact that he did his ride continuously rather than over the course of two days. Really fucking amazing. Considering that it was me, and it was me on the Big Dummy for 165+ miles, I still considered it a happy conclusion. I wanted to write more. I wanted to write something beautiful and lonely. 

But for some reason the words aren't there. Pictures will be, soon. Tomorrow I'm going to line up at the start of Grandma's marathon with thousands of other people. This morning I decided that in spite of everything, I will run the marathon. I'm not going to finish in a good time. My legs are still sore from the bike ride, I haven't run in a couple weeks, and my training this year didn't go beyond seventeen miles. But I will run anyway. Why? I'm not sure. Maybe it's because my bib number is 2619...26.19. It struck me as rather funny. Maybe it's to see how much I can endure. Not how fast or fit I am, but only how much suffering I can take. To be continued...
