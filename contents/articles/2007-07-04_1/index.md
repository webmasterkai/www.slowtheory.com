there is an agreement between she and I not to mention each other to each other hello ...it's me is it? and we go on like this pretending there isn't any reply oblivious proud so fucking proud that we are not the least bit curious it is a fact we say that we are not known to one another as anything except ideas we have not touched or shared a cup of coffee or squeezed into the same shower space shivering while the other takes his or her turn when I see a telephone number I am frightened by repeating digits or familiar digits or blocked numbers or foreign area codes Â­this was our agreement to cower in our individual spaces our heads full of fluff our gait pretentious and preposterous to remain completely unapproachable cowering in fear of phone numbers hello ...it's me is it? and we go on like this I'll probably never write again.
