Despite the $100 entry fee (which is absurd) I signed up for the Twin Cities marathon. Two years ago I signed up for it and did not run. Things didn't come together. This year I have confidence, some base fitness from running Hilo, and a desire to finish something that I left unfinished. I still intend to keep my training somewhat selective/limited to avoid injury/overtraining, but I am going to follow more of a *plan* this time and potentially try to run *a bit faster*. I seem to get a little bit better every marathon both in my fitness and my ability to run smart. I didn't make any mistakes during the Hilo run. I wasn't the fastest person out there, but I ran to the best of my ability and didn't do anything excessively stupid/macho/weak/foolish. I had a plan and I executed it. Perhaps it is not the most romantic way to describe running a marathon. It was still an emotional and spiritual experience. I'll never be fit enough for it not to be *that*. Anyway. That's the plan for this year. Fewer bike events. More footracing. I kind of like footracing.
