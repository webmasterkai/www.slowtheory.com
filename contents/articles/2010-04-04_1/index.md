I slept twelve hours last night. the busiest day in the history of the bike shop was reason enough to finally let the accumulated fatigue of the past several weeks knock me on my face. I skipped dinner, skipped doing things, and fell into a sleep that retained nothing of consciousness. as I started to wake up, I fought it. no, I want to go back to sleep... eventually I had no choice and I got out of bed. I have been depressed and lethargic. there is no food in the house and even though I have loaded the dishwasher I have not taken the time to procure dishwasher detergent. something smells terrible in the trash (chicken packaging I imagine) and the laundry that I brought upstairs a couple days ago remains on the floor in the bedroom. my coffee tastes like shit and two of my bikes are essentially broken. somewhat amazingly, I don't even feel like eating when I am at home. I usually love to eat when I am sad but this seems to be a more penetrating kind of sadness. the inexpressibility of the helplessness.

yesterday dave and I were riding home and noticed a man dressed in a pizza suit advertising for papa johns. this was on the northwest corner of the intersection. moments later we realized that on the northeast corner of the intersection there was a sleazy old man with a sign for little caesers's. they were both soundless and bobbing ridiculously. I wish that I would have taken the time to get a photo, because it was one of the best things that I've experienced in a long time. the price of the papa johns deal was twice that of the little caeser's deal but the foam suit seemed much more inviting than an old man with creepy sunglasses.

I briefly contemplated mustering the courage and energy to go to the store, only to realize that it's a holiday today. well damn.
