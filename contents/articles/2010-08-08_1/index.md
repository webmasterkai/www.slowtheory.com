*the next day*. foggily trying to recollect while sipping gatorade.  
  
*prelude. *I knew that it was going to be a good night. it's unusual that I have such a strong, positive vibe about something *unknown*. but I liked it. I left the bike shop late after getting overinvested in an on the fly repair for a very good customer. I rode fast, got sweaty, still arrived eight minutes early. it was strange to see the place under such different circumstances. I watched the water move quickly. shallow water and a strong wind produced an exaggerated motion of being swept away. the sun had emerged. the night would end in rain. that much I knew.  
  
*a plate of sushi*. I ordered a plate of sushi and an american beer. classy shit. I knew how to behave. I gingerly dabbed at my hands with the warm towel and feigned ordinariness. in myself I acquired a believer. eye contact was easier because souls were already being bared without compromise. that's why we were there. *am I supposed to be eating this? ...the night is young, tim.*  
  
*proposition in the manner of a walk*. it suddenly occurred to me that I wanted to learn how to geocache. I vaguely knew what it was and that if given the proper circumstances, I wanted to do it. we decided to stop for drinks first. the sun slowly disappeared as we sipped our *farmer's tan* from goblets. my senses were heightened and I began to pick up pieces of conversations that were happening around us. I was so pleased to be in *our conversation*. this was the place of storytelling.  
  
*shimmying across a metal beam*. we chose the most difficult geocache in the area. I didn't really know how my recently downloaded iphone application worked, so I neglected to get a description, hint, or indication of the size of the object. the search, however, was brilliant. in the dark we tiptoed along streams, shimmied across metal beams and scrambled our way up steep embankments. from our vantage point the lightning flashed silently above the impressive structures now looming large in the sky. all of my senses changed in that moment. the proximity of things to me became increasingly irrelevant. I could feel them as if connected to me along the periodic bursts of lights that translated my changed features into sight and expression. the object remained elusive.  
  
*across the river*. we walked across the river in search of the next object. after hiding under the stone arch bridge from the rain we found ourselves on a ledge high above an illuminated mass of churning water near the mill city ruins. again, the object escaped us. this time it was because someone had removed it. the next ten, twenty, thirty, fifty or eighty minutes were spent under the stone arch bridge, watching and listening to the rain, while burying my head in the sand and experiencing the climactic fluctuation of *being there*.  
  
*ghost town*. 3:30am. in twenty minutes of walking we did not encounter any other people. bare feet and puddle finding.  
  
*three glasses of fridge water. *I drank greedily while scrutinizing house plants and margin notes.  
  
*receptivity*. in spite of going home without having found a single object, the night could not have been much better.
