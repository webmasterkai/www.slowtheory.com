after exhausting my options for friends I set off for another solo sunday ride. the original adventure-heavy route was altered for a slightly shorter, less adventurous alternative. I wanted to save the original for a weekend when others could share in the experience. I was also concerned that trail conditions would be less than optimal.

I left early, riding south on the river road. I had a slight tailwind. I would pay for this tailwind by facing a much stiffer headwind on the way home. I was making excellent time when I reached the mendota bridge. it was in terrible condition. almost completely unrideable. I watched for at least ten minutes as another cyclist walking in the other direction neared me. he was even less equipped, dragging alongside him a brakeless track bike with 23mm slick tires. "nice day for a walk," I said. he grunted. I'm not hip. I stopped for a sandwich.

after going through downtown I went up towards mounds park via the vento. it is a long climb from the river and then a steeper climb to the top. during the winter I don't see a lot of hills. I spend a lot of my time riding on the paved trails in the minneapolis area, where the steepest climbs are bridges and exit ramps. by the top of the climb I was quite tired. I then turned north and into the wind along johnson parkway. it's not a fun road to ride, but the vento appeared to be in poor condition, and after walking the mendota bridge I wasn't keen on slowly picking my way north.

I then rode back to the greenway via the bike shop. I was surprised by the small number of people on the trail. I planned to ride out to the lrt but instead called it a day just shy of fifty miles. I really need to find a way to keep myself motivated on long, solo, winter rides. it just stops being fun after a couple hours. maybe I need to explore new places.

the tricross was fantastic. I can tell that I'm really going to like it. it's the bike that I should have owned a bunch of different times, a near perfect compromise between the versatility of a touring bike and the speed of a road bike. I'd like to lower the gearing, but other than that I'll need to make very few changes.
