Three days ago I had all four of my wisdom teeth removed. The procedure was much less of an ordeal than I anticipated. Over the years various dentists have looked at them and uttered, *those have to go...and it's going to be a mess to do it.* Various explanations for the proposed difficulty were posited, including the structure of my roots, the proximity of nerves, the likelihood of rupturing the sinus cavity, and most recently, my advanced age (apparently, 31 is OLD). I ended up having the procedure done at our neighbors to the near south, [Saint Paul Family Denistry][1]. They did an excellent job of explaining the situation to me, suggesting a course of action, executing it flawlessly, and following up attentively, thus ensuring a swift recovery free from the horrifying complications that I spent days reading about on the Internet. Anyway, local business plug aside, this has meant that I've been off of my bike for *three days*. I have gone periods of more than a year without having a single day away from my bike, so it's been challenging/unsettling/disconcerting/boring/frustrating. In spite of my unexpectedly quick recovery, I have run out of things to do...more accurately, I have run out of the requisite patience and tolerance for being inside. I am feeling good enough that I may go out for a ride today, or at least a short, easy run. Tomorrow should be business as usual. Not bad. Not bad.  
  
For anyone not following the [Iditarod Trail Invitational][2], you should probably know that Alaska has had a winter completely opposite of ours. A prolonged cold snap, during which temperatures regularly reached -50F, was followed by a huge snow storm. Presently, the race is being led by a *runner*. Yep, that's right. The remaining bikers have pushed their bikes the majority of the couple hundred miles that they have traversed so far, and are still hours behind runner, Tim Hewitt. It appears that in the past twelve hours they've started riding, and will most likely pass him before the finish. Nonetheless, it is still hugely impressive that 1.) a 57 year old runner has led the race for so long, and 2.) even a handful of bikers will finish, having walked more than pedaled. This is the kind of bike racing that I find immensely inspiring.
