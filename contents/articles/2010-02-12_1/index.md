so, the details: due to fortunate circumstances I was able to act quickly on my new bike purchase for the year. I was also able to elevate from the tricross base model to the tricross comp. I was especially fond of the brown and tan paint scheme. the nicer parts and increased amount of mystical carbon fiber further enticed me. with rack and fenders it is only a bit over 23 pounds, and could be even lighter with a more road oriented pair of tires. it's going to make a very nice longer distance camping bike.

I took the studded tires from the aframe, put them on the tricross and rode it home today. the fit was a little bit off. my saddle was much too far rearward and not a wtb sst. this made for an uncomfortable ride and subsequent back pain. I swapped with my big dummy when I got home and expect much better results on my next ride. it was a little bit awkward shifting with gloves after using pogies all winter, but I think I'll be able to adapt. plus, it should be warm enough soon that I can abandon the lobster mitts and use a normal glove. then no gloves at all!

gearing is good but not great. they clearly put some thought into it, but it's still geared a bit too high for my tastes. the low end is a fairly standard 34x27. at 90rpm that would mean always riding over 9mph. not a problem most of the time, but loaded with camping gear at the end of a hundred mile day it'd be more than I could handle. I've considered a few options, but really don't want to put any money into it. I may spend a few bucks on a 29 tooth miche cog to slightly extend the range. I certainly don't need a 12 tooth, so modifying my cassette to a custom 13-29 might offer the best bang for the buck.

I'm looking forward to getting in some longer training rides in the coming weeks that aren't on the pugsley.
