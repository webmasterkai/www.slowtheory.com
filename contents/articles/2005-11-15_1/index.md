i’m with my third grade lover, my head resting delicately in her lap while she mindlessly moves her fingers through my hair. my eyes are closed and my cheek is pressed against her warm thigh, slightly distorting the words that i’m whispering to her in a hushed lullaby. she tilts her head as she speaks to me, telling me that she always noticed and meant to smile. she wanted to guide me to the place where lovers lie and grip my hand in hers, moving it over her tender flesh and teaching me not to be afraid. she wanted to pull my body next to hers and untie the strings that bound our spirits to our person. i tell her that i often thought of my congealed insides melting away against the rhythmic motion of mine against hers. i wanted with lust and animal precision. she pauses and i feel her lungs fill against me and her pulse quicken. her hand stops moving and i awake with an empty chalice in my left hand. i put it down and from the banister i grip a small knife. i press the blade between my fingers and the metallic warmth enlivens me. i grip it in my right hand and with a perpendicular motion i sweep it across my left wrist. my disbelieving eyes question the small chasm that emerges, walled on each side by angles of newly exposed flesh, soft against the dim glow of moonlight reflected off of my tears. a moment. a breath. a pause. and silence. first one speckle, and then another, and another until the walls of the chasm taint the moon a dull maroon. the chasm fills and i once again grip the chalice, this time in my right hand, holding my left hand over its wide opening and listening as the first droplet lands, a hollow thud. they come slowly at first. i watch the chalice begin to fill and i feel their pace quicken until the droplets erode into a steam. before i have a chance to react it is overflowing, the steam now uncontrollable and the chalice balancing anxiously in my fingertips. i feel my legs tremble beneath me and my vision blurs. i collapse.

i hear voices but i am too weak to open my eyes or move.  
"did you mean it?"  
"i meant it when i meant it."  
"when did you mean it?"
"when i said it."  
"when did you say it?"  
"when i meant it."  
"does it mean anything that you meant it when you said it?"  
"it was beautiful."  
"it was prognostic."  
"it was real."
"was it?"  
"when it was real."  
"is it real forever?"  
"ab--...."

there is a sound like a balloon deflating and the voices stop. i listen to one pair of footsteps moving away. i hear a drip.
