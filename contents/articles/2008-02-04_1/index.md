Of course, it was well known to those well known to me that it would turn upon me as such. It's snowing now. I would certainly offer that explanation given even the slightest inopportunity. I watch it drift slowly to the ground, but it does not look particularly like flakes this day--no, more like distortion to the rhapsodic gray doom of this suffocating landscape. The lines of the garage become grainy and less jagged. I filter, parse, ruminate, expostulate, and then I am done. I have approached the object extensionally and come away with nothing. I will begin to describe a pervasive thought and then stop, wait for it to conclude. The idea must become necessarily my opposite. I must root myself in the dead simplicity of biology and chemistry, taking into account that my brain functions are wedded to these things by an equal necessity. 

So I describe: in the past week I have run near a winter snow sculpting area at the state fairgrounds. I have studied the objects as well as one can while maintaining continuous forward momentum. The first time the objects were still being formed--there were castles, squirrels and so on. The second time the objects looked very refined. I was surprised by the level of detail that the sculptors achieved given indecisive weather and snow conditions. This last time the objects appeared to be in a general state of dilapidation. The weather, of course, has been much warmer. Over the course of a week I feel as though I have seen the entire lifespan of an instance of creation--its construction, beauty and degradation. I wondered what it would have looked like if I'd set up a time lapse camera and photographed the sculptures every hour for the past week. Naturally I then contemplated the same question of a living thing.
