It was two days after the marathon. We woke up across the street from the Volcano park at a free campground, elevation ~4000ft. It was a chilly, beautiful, blue morning. Around us life stirred. The wind surged and the forest bent at its will. We sat in the picnic area, cumulatively wearing all of the warm clothing that we'd brought to the Big Island. I did more than my share by wearing all of my clothing and some of Matt's. I was so ill prepared for the week that I had only one pair of socks: the pair that I ran a marathon in two days earlier. Of course, it didn't matter to me because this was the *vacation* part of the vacation. With the anxiety of running a marathon behind me, I could have endured cold feet. Nonetheless, I was fortunate that Matt had overpacked and had a spare pair of socks for me.  

As we ate our breakfast we discussed options for the day. We casually decided on a backcountry hike and a night spent elsewhere. Michelle volunteered to go to the park office and get a permit and plan a route. Great! We had the entire day. What could possibly go wrong? Matt and I lazily cleaned the dishes and packed the breakfast food. Michelle returned with a backcountry map and a plan. She planned a three day journey that would be about eleven miles the first day, seven or so the second, and only five or six on the last day. It seemed like a very solid plan. It would be a long hike, but we were hiking down to the sea, so the longest day would be all downhill. Thumbs up. We divided our gear, packed appropriate food, and started for the trailhead.

We reached the trailhead and I noticed three things: it was a desert trail (in spite of the name "Desert trail" I thought it might be lush and tropical), it was WINDY, and it was much later in the day that I thought. In fact, it was almost 11am. The sun would set around 6:30pm. The math still worked out favorably for us, but not as certainly as I would have liked. A cabin marked the almost-halfway point of the hike, so we decided on a conservative turnaround point: if we didn't reach the cabin by 2pm we would return to the car and camp at the same place we did the previous night. Matt was being sensible and cautious, so while he emailed detailed plans to Maria (prudent, as we all lost cellphone service quickly thereafter) I gorged on fruit. We ate a pineapple, a bunch of papaya, a mango, and a couple of bananas.

We started hiking. I was pleased with how my new pack felt, and in spite of the wind we were moving quickly and efficiently. In a rare moment of foresight, we were each equipped with a water bladder and one or two bottles. Between us we had about 500 ounces of water. Michelle and I were both hiking in running shoes, but other than that we looked like we knew what we were doing. While we stopped for a pee break, we encountered the only person we would see for the next twenty-four hours: a park ranger. He told us we were almost to the cabin. *Great. *We were making excellent time. The trail was easy to follow and generally not very challenging, and while it was *kind of* barren, it wasn't desolate. We reached the cabin well ahead of our turnaround time and stopped for lunch.
