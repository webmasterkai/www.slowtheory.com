In the past twenty four hours I have seen the following things that have made life seem much more worthwhile: 

- On the way back from the bookstore we stopped at Menards. Since moving my lighting system to the TC X I haven't had a front light on the xtracycle. Although I didn't find the parts I needed, I did return to the bike rack to find a Karate Monkey locked up next to my bike, towing behind it a homemade four wheel trailer that looked absolutely awesome, but must have been a bitch to tote around. It was clamped loosely around the seatpost. 
- The Menards that I visit has a strangely placed piano between the sliding belts that carry people from the lower to the upper floor and vice versa. It is roped off and I'm not sure if it is meant to be played by anyone, only appointed Menards pianists, or no one at all. In any case, there was a kid playing the piano while we were going to the second floor. He obviously didn't know how to play, but his willingness to look like a fool and his excitement and energy were more refreshing than a million smug connoisseurs. 
- This morning I left early for work so that I could stop at the grocery store and, time permitting, do some reading and blogging before the store opened. As I turned on to Arlington I noticed a stunning young lady running on the sidewalk on the other side of the street. My admiration stemmed from the following: she was obviously very dedicated and valued the peacefulness of early morning, she was fucking fast, and she was beautiful. 
- As I went by she glanced over and I quickly realized that my admiration could easily be confused with ogling. However, rather than give me a dirty look or pretend I didn't exist, she offered a friendly wave. I almost crashed my bicycle. As I was leaving the grocery store I ran into the singing cartboy. He seems like he's probably awful at his job, but this morning he fucking nailed Amazing Grace. Actually, I don't know if that's what he was singing, but it sort of sounded like it and his facial expressions matched perfectly.
