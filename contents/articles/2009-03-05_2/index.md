This post is a continuation of an earlier post. "My shoes threatened to slip with each movement on the wet terrain, so I ended up crab-walking my way down much of the ridge. As we neared the forest I reached to my back pocket to grab one last photo of the storm shrouded summit. It was not there. Whether because of gumption or footwear, Matt was doing much better than I was. He must have seen the despair in my eyes and offered to go back for it while I continued ahead into the relative safety of the forest. I reached an intersection and found a purple band on the ground, a pink band to the left, and nothing to the right. Since we'd followed purple all day, I assumed that the marker had simply fallen to the ground from the unmarked side. I felt myself moving more quickly as the terrain grew rapidly unfamiliar. Images of Les Stroud talking about lost hikers flashed through my mind. Move slower. Breathe deeper. This is the wrong trail. I didn't want to believe it, but I had no choice. I turned around, sprinting up this new and unfamiliar ridge to find Matt and the correct trail. Despite the blatant stupidity in both our choice to separate and my choice to continue on a trail that was obviously wrong, everything worked out well. Matt found the camera and we found each other. As we moved to the lower elevations I grew more comfortable. It hadn't rained as much further down the mountain. I did lose my footing once, sliding on my ass for several feet before coming to a stop against a root. I was relieved that it hadn't happened earlier. Our descent went quickly. As we neared the spot where we'd been charged by the bull, I wielded a fallen tree branch and puffed up my chest."
