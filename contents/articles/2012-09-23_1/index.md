It was a promising start. We heard the bus from Kai's backyard, ran, arriving just moments before it was about to leave. Exiting the bus, we heard the lightrail approaching. No time lost. No annoyances. This was followed by a flight that departed/arrived on time. We then haphazardly connected a network of trams and sidewalks that brought us out of the airport. *Shit*. "Everything is going perfectly." The walk from the airport to our hotel should have been about three miles. It ended up being much longer as we were introduced to the labyrinth of concrete that makes up the Las Vegas underbelly.

We kept looking up, pointing, and asking, *how do we get up there?* Las Vegas is inside. It is air conditioned. It smells like damp cigarette butts, liquor, axe, and mint lifesavers. It is disgusting. The question has been posed by many before me (haha, and even by someone we met walking on the return trip to the airport who is "in the adult film industry"). We had lunch and formulated a plan for the rest of the day. Go to the outdoor demo and find a grocery store. Dining out was not only gross and unhealthy, but terribly expensive.  
  
After checking into our room, we walked to the Sands convention center, where we would catch a bus to the outdoor expo. It was mid-afternoon. We would only have a couple hours. It was hot. We ended up walking around and looking at stuff, but riding nothing as we wasted too much time walking around looking/talking/touching. By the time we wanted to ride something, they wouldn't let us. Back to the city.

We found an Albertsons pin on my iPhone map and started walking towards it. It was a couple miles out of the way, but we needed food. The walking was getting tiring. By the end of the day, we would cover around 11 miles, much of it with heavy backpacks. When we arrived at the spot, there was no grocery store. We bushwhacked, hopped a fence, and found ourselves on the back side of the Bellagio. "No sir, I don't know what you're talking about...this is the BELL-AHHH-GJEE-OHHHHHH-hiss." No food. Just more miles on our feet. It felt like a prison. Concrete everywhere. Dead ends. The funnel effect. Regimented food, dress, behavior. Confined to the thoughtfully erected structures that define and monitor inorganic *self*, and further, the repetition of that *thing* upon those who follow in your footsteps. Vegas baby, Vegas.
