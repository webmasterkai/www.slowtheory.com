waving from the silent nunnery, the third floor of the brick and mortar capital of space time headquarters, the sisters of scorn put on a face, perfected. they like being dead and incapable; the motion of their hand in an ellipse feigns desire. i love them still, as i wander through this barren city with the drunkards, the lowlifes, and the poets with no confidence. two blocks ago i was stopped by a future martyr. he asked me, "how much longer?". i told him that i didn't know, but that i had prayed to mylar gods on his behalf each moment since we'd first crossed paths. i lied to give him sanction. i ruthlessly forgave and he advanced martyrdom through compassion. my footsteps shuffle forward in real time and i smell and feel my own breath, ripe and toxic against momentary space reduced to the humid stench of this place and its terminal illness. the messiah sits on the curb near the marketplace feeding the pigeons day old bread with a cardboard sign propped against his backpack that reads, "damn it all." i spill beer on my favorite sweater and curse away the bees. i synchronize, for a moment, with the birds and perch on my twenty-five pound hump. it opens and my first instinct is to twist to the side, one fist still anchoring me to the ground in the stance of a forbidden ape. i slowly turn my head back with eyes fluttering, flirting to close. i don't have to wake up in the morning. this is my androgen. i can taste it in the air and i feel it closing around me, wrapping me up in the leaflets of earth's want to temper. i've finally got it figured out. i eat glue and become stupid.

the messiah leads me with his hand craned as if its adorned with a sock puppet. his fingers rest delicately in my palm and i feel saliva balancing at the point where upper and lower lip meet. my mouth is partially dilated and threatens the birth of new word. the messiahs turns quickly and awkwardly slurs, "hey, look over there!" i look and out of the corner of my eye i see his body rock back just an instant before his balled fist makes contact near my right eyebrow.

i wake up here.

this week has been a canned disaster. a frightful assembly of haunting and twitching.
