I generally try to avoid the topic of politics. but... you have got to be fucking kidding me. people are walking around without health care and we're considering a holiday...from gasoline taxes? in a nation struggling with obesity and stuff? where people spend twenty minutes looking for parking when they could have walked to their destination in five? fucked up priorities. last week a guy came into the shop looking for a bike to use for commuting. he had definitely let himself go, but he came in confident that twenty-five miles on a bicycle was completely feasible. he'll cut that distance in half initially by using public transportation, but his mindset was refreshing. he's going to be happy and healthy, and in the end, save some money. that's what we need. not a fucking gas tax holiday. vote obama. do it. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...
