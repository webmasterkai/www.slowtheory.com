watching the cat move. tumbles on to its back cleaning itself where I just touched it. unusual cat. irritable. if I touch anywhere but the head I will be bitten. a whimper? that was a whimper. are you really here? if I shift just slightly the light hits my eyes and you disappear into my decimated pupils. talk to me. I touch its tail lightly. it shifts. oberst?
