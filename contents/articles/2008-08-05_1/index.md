He took the thing from his pocket and turned it about in his hands. Always wishing, eyes screaming towards the heavens, he limited his contact at all times to no more than a finger and a thumb. Although he seemed to be curiously insulted by the object, it was quite obvious that he meant never to let go of the thing. Had I attempted to take the object from him it was clear in my mind that my efforts would be futile. In spite of an obvious difference in size and strength, the confidence with which he moved convinced me that I would be no match. I first took notice of him not because of the object, or the strange, vacant expression on his face, but because I meant to find some flaw in him that would make my moments in his presence less excruciating. I struggle thinking that everyone around me is secretly despising me, mocking my poorly disguised faults. When I have only walls around me I understand that to assume such a thing is a most pitiful form of flattery. The truth is that people notice very little about each other, they are mostly indifferent. I have trained myself to feel this way about most people. I'm genuinely surprised when people remember a story that I've told or when a stranger happens to remember my name. Sometimes though, I falter and need to find fault in those around me so that I do not feel alone or strange. I watched him turn the thing about in his hands and thought how foolish he looked, how much passion there was in his dim expression, how much conviction there was in his loose grasp on the object. It exhibited a type of strength that is uncommon and most often uncalled for.

I'm off to a good start for grandma's 2009. In the first five days of august I'm already down five pounds. Most of that is likely water weight from having too much sodium in my pre-august diet and my digestive system just generally recovering from too many starchy carbohydrates and too much ice cream. Getting to 170 by the time the snow flies shouldn't pose a problem. It will be maintaining it over the depressing winter that's difficult.

I've shifted my weight lifting to focus on endurance. The last thing that I want to do is build any additional upper body mass. I have as much muscle mass as I consider practical for the activities that I enjoy, so this morning I switched all of my sets to 15 reps from 8 and worked in a number of circuit sets. It's weird. I can tell that I don't have that type of strength. The first few reps I have trouble not throwing the weight through the garage roof, but by the 15th my arms are twitching and I'm winded. 

I'm feeling good. I have something to obsess over, numbers to analyze. It fills space. It gives me purpose. In the end it means nothing, but I pretend like I don't recognize that.
