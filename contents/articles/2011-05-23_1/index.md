I have just about a month to figure out my living situation. I've narrowed it down to four possibilities, which I have ranked here and intend to pursue in numerical order.  
  
1.) A solid roommate potential has emerged in the past week. I could keep rent costs down and live in a nice space with a totally unobjectionable person. This is probably my favorite option at the moment, but you never know when you introduce the variable of another person. He has at least one option available that I do not have, and if he chooses to take it then I will be left to decide between my remaining choices. Nevertheless, this holds the most potential and will be henceforth known as "Plan [ubiquitous] A".  
  
2.) While I first considered this option somewhat jokingly, after working out the logistics in my mind it seems like it could work. "Plan B" is to simply do nothing. Well, that isn't quite true. This plan is to find a place to store my larger things and embark on a three or four month sort of "bike tour" that does not involve going anywhere in particular or taking any time off from work. I could simply find places to camp for the rest of the warm season. This could include local campgrounds or the yards of friends. I could potentially save over $3000 in rent and have an interesting summer adventure. I have access to multiple showers including the one at the gym near my work and Michelle's. I could temporarily forward my mail to the bike shop and access the internet either at work or from the library. This option has shot up to the number two position in the last few days as my futile search has continued.  
  
3.) Find a room in a house somewhere, most likely with strangers. This was the first option that I pursued. I have met interesting people who are renting rooms at very reasonable rates. This is a very good option with one small problem: almost everyone has a cat. The few places that I've found that I thought would be eminently livable had at least one cat in the house. I cannot live with a cat. While I still peruse craigslist in hopes of finding a good situation, my resolve has waned significantly and it would now take an extremely fatalistic act to make this my best option.  
  
4.) Find a one bedroom. There are options, but not many. I want to save some money. It is idiotic to spend almost $10,000/year renting. I have looked at a couple places around $550/month, but they have been generally underwhelming with gross and minimal living space, disgusting carpet, and poor locations. I think finding a nice place (especially one in a four-plex or smaller) at a reasonable price isn't going to happen. I'm just not willing to throw that much money away anymore.
