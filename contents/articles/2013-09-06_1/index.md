It is my birthday today. I woke up at 5:22am to wish Bunda good luck on his 100 mile journey up the Superior Hiking trail. He and his crew quickly departed and I found myself facing a quiet morning alone. Then, slow movements--celebrating the freedoms that we begin to appreciate as we grow older. I drank some coffee, went to breakfast, chatted with some crew members for other 100 mile racers, and began dealing with the logistics of my own 50 mile race that begins tomorrow at 6am. My goal in arriving early was twofold--enjoy a relaxing day pre-race and witness the craziness of the 100 milers doing their thing. It is on my radar to attempt a 100, and I find that the mystique and intimidation is lessened by seeing that it is a real thing, enjoyed by real, normal people. I don't want to get too far ahead of myself. Tomorrow will be the longest race that I've ever attempted, a fact that I have to remind myself of when I am in the company of such accomplished athletes. My race is *only* fifty miles, but to me that's a pretty big deal.

I will start easy, and continue at that pace until it is no longer easy. I will try to eat, drink, and take advantage of the aid stations. I will try to move forward as quickly and efficiently as possible. I will stop periodically to appreciate the transient beauty of my surroundings. In short, I will live-life in the microcosm of this simple world where there is nothing unessential. We move, we eat, we drink, and we find spiritual fulfillment. We feel empathy, joy, pride, despair, and all of the other things that make us uniquely human.
