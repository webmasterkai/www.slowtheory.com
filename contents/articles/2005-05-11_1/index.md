I took a bath today. Mandarin orange bubble bath. I couldn't believe how real it was. My body hurt everywhere. I lifted weights yesterday morning, rode my bike in the afternoon, and went jogging in the evening. I want to see what I'm capable of. I want to see how much I can take before I collapse into a puddle. I want to see if I'm what I think I am. Today I went to the UPS store to drop off a bike that I sold on ebay. I ate dinner at a friend's and enjoyed free tacos and beer. I wanted to eat cereal this morning but I didn't have any, so I listened to Hank Williams and washed my dishes and thought about cereal. I have a job interview tomorrow and I have no idea what it's for. I think it's going to be a pyramid scheme or some kind of telemarketing position. I have nothing better to do than go there to see what it is about. The end is coming.
