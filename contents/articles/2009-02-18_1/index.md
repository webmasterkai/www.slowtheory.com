There weren't very many interesting people at the gym today, so instead of reflecting on human oddities in a given environment, I will write down my workout:

- Squats: 135x10, 155x10, 165x10, 175x10, 185x10 
- Leg Press: 270x10, 300x10
- Single leg split squat: 135x10,10; 135x10,10 
- Leg Raise: 
- BWx25 Hypers: 35x10, 35x10 
- Decline crunch: 10x10, 10x10 
- Adducter: most of it x a bunch 
- Abducter: most of it x a bunch

Yeah, it's much less interesting than the groaning/screaming/weeping man.
