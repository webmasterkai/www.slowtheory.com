It was a bit colder than I expected. Saturday I had gone out on a forty-five mile test run covering much of the same territory. I quickly concluded that my equipment choices from Saturday would have little relevance to Sunday's ride. It was still well below freezing when we gathered at 9am outside of the apartment. Clear skies and not much wind, but everything that had melted the previous day had once again frozen. The ride started as one of the biggest in Sunday ride history: five people. Unfortunately, A-train showed up with the General only because he did not want to call to cancel. After about a mile and a half he announced that they were done. I was still a bit stiff from Saturday's ride, so it took me a while to get warmed up. We headed up second to Memorial Parkway, a new favorite for winter rides. Our progress was slowed by patches of ice that were very difficult to navigate without studded tires. We made it to the Cedar Lake trail where I had my first and only crash of the day. It was an extended section of skating rink quality ice. My front wheel slipped and I gracefully plopped sideways into the snow bank. It was almost fun. The snow was soft. I felt childish. The rest of the Cedar Lake trail was littered with similarly difficult sections of ice. By the time we finally reached the Depot we were running seriously behind schedule. "Schedule", in this case, meant only trying to fit the ride into daylight hours. Options were discussed for cutting the ride short. "We'll wait and see what the light situation is on the way back." In the mean time, I enjoyed delicious pumpkin bread and coffee.

Things improved on the LRT. The snow was packed and foot traffic was light. We made good progress, delaying only a few times for nutritional or mechanical breaks. My chain started skipping around mile forty and continued for much of the next ten miles. One of the jockey wheels had turned into an icy disc. Beating the ice off with a stick helped the problem, but it was still happening in the higher gears. I resigned myself to dealing with what was left. Even though it was a bummer, I was having fun and tried to remain upbeat, allowing myself only the occasional drivetrain directed profanity. 

On the way down the Greenway we stopped at Arby's. While I find fast food generally repulsive, nothing is more appealing during strenuous cycling efforts. Quick and easy calories. I had a roast beef sandwich, french fries, and a soda. Hah! Progress on the Greenway was outstanding. Conditions were good and we had a slight tailwind.

We turned off at Dean Parkway. The lake area was busy, but the roads around the lakes have speed limits not far off from the speed we were traveling, so none of the car traffic seemed particularly bothered by our presence. It was good to see people out enjoying the weather. Calhoun approached near summer worthy numbers of dog walkers and runners. We reached Minnehaha, where once again we returned to the multi use trails. The conditions were much better than on the Cedar Lake trail, but worse than the Greenway. The combination of high foot traffic and the increased temperature meant that instead of ice, the biggest challenge would be slushy snow. This made me happy since my tires were much better suited to those conditions.

It wasn't long before we were on the other side of the river. I had prepared myself for a hike-a-bike down the trail that connects Mendota and Lilydale, but to my surprise the trail was plowed! This is the first winter that I've seen it plowed, and not only was it plowed, it was plowed really well. Excellent! We were flying, relatively speaking.

Jeff called Kara to let her know that he was still alive, and I ate a granola bar. The ride was getting really long.

Nightfall came just as we hit the Bruce Vento trail. The combination of limited visibility and refreeze made it a particularly treacherous section for me. I stopped a number of times to trot alongside the snowbank rather than risk another crash. Whatever benefits I got from my tire choice were quickly and heavily outweighed by the otherwise unnecessary accelerations. It's funny the difference a few degrees can have on one's experience. Saturday everything was melted and I could cruise along quite happily, while Sunday it was just a bit colder and long sections were nearly unrideable without studs. Nonetheless, we eventually made it to the Jeff and Kara's house.

Kara was kind enough to make us sandwiches and cookies. It was a nice stop to have so late in a ride and gave me all the energy I'd need to make it home. Jeff rode with us for a short distance on his Pugsley with the deathray and Freddie's Revenz studded tires. It was a frightening thing to behold. Once he'd made 100 miles for the day he turned back. The trail was peaceful and the moon bright. I felt great. I was in love with life. The ride was leisurely, almost lackadaisical. It gave me a chance to be outside, to breathe in the crisp air and breathe out anxiety. We detoured slightly on the way home in order to end at exactly 100 miles. It's been a long time since I've ridden a February century. Ryan finished the ride on a singlespeed with dual studs. Impressive, and surely good enough to give the A-train a challenge for February.
