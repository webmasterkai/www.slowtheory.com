When I started writing about Vegas, I assumed that I would diligently chronicle each day, fiercely clutching at those fading memories in want...no, *need*...of their necessary translation into a more permanent medium. Alas, I soon realized that most of the trip was somewhere between unremarkable and appalling. I love Minneapolis. I'll say that up front. Nonetheless, I think I can objectively say that downtown Las Vegas is a pretty terrible place. Trucks drive around twenty-four hours a day with billboards advertising highly suggestive escort services. Cab drivers roar their engines and narrowly avoid running over pedestrians. The odor of cigarettes, cheap booze, and utter disappointment fills half of the rooms, sharply contrasting against the lifesavers and axe body spray, artificially enhancing the apparent elegance of the latter. Street corners no longer have newspapers. They only have cheap, desperate sex. Outside, no wildlife. It is the desert, except made up of concrete, colorful lighting, and astroturf. In my mind it was a dystopian glance into the future, what the world will become when all landscape has been transformed into a barren wasteland, and all people have desperately moved indoors, forgetting everything about their existence other than the hedonistic indulgences that constitute their forever-reduced-self. This is Vegas. It is the culture of traffic. Darting across lanes of traffic is no longer a sprint. It is a mid-distance gallop. One two three five seven nine twelve. On and on. The thing sprawls out. When we finally do find a grocery store it is more of the same. The suburbs are filled with plastic bags and the amusement of the locals as we load our vegetables into our backpacks. Do you want bags? No? *No??!* The sliding glass doors are tinted green. It changes the color of everything in the room, but in a few minutes I don't even see it anymore. At one point, this feature of human adaptation was probably quite useful, but now it allows for an intolerable degree of tolerance for inhuman experience. In my mind I am concerned that the orchestration of the Vegas bike event is a purely nefarious effort of the automotive industry to kill the bicycle. Put the expo in concrete hell, and hope the passion dies. On the faces of many, it did just that. But it was not everywhere, or for everyone. We skulked our way around the perimeter, weaving in and out of e-bom-ination bikes and novelty tires to find the people who actually *understand. *In those small places, hope.
