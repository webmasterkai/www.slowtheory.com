if i am quiet it is only that the air of a moment has breathed into me that we could have grown, that if only the stupid things hadn’t pulled us apart we could find so many ways to change. you were always the sense to my haughty nonsense, to my whimsy and my wanderlust—and if only that confidence hadn’t, in a moment of despair, lost itself to the loneliness of the skin over the midnight hour, things might have been learned and scars might have healed into hearts. so if i am lost, if i seem truly wretched, then it is because my eyes have begun to wander and my fingers to reminisce, but not because i have grown weary of the now of the never, not that i do not enjoy the company of a friend or a conversation layered in nuance and history, but because i have done what i never thought i could do: i have buried myself with a shovel and a mound of dirt.

i biked to the lake around midnight, ran around once, and biked home. i was fast on the bike and slow on foot. i guess that’s how it goes. i’m never afraid at night—except tonight. i veered around the night darkened trees, sped up where i thought i might escape, and slowed down where i thought i might make my final stand. i don’t know what i was afraid of or why my feet felt so slow or why the shadows seemed so dark. perhaps i’m no longer the worst thing lurking in the night.
