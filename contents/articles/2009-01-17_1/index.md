I celebrated the warmer temperatures with an eight mile run. As I went through the fairgrounds the temperature was 1F. By the time I got home it was up to 4F. Balmy! It was fun. I've been doing a lot of indoor things this winter as the harsh conditions have worn on my spirits. It was different tonight. There was little wind and the powdery snow seemed to hang endlessly in the air, my personal kaleidoscope of shimmering stars. "Coming up behind you." "Yeah," she said, turning and giving me an almost sickeningly sweet smile. "Thanks." If I hadn't been so in love with the evening I would have either questioned its authenticity or retched at its genuineness. No headphones. Just the twisting sound of my feet on the snow. It was nice to slow things down. Time passed differently. I moved in the shape of a flower around the apartment, each petal representing an unwillingness to let my escape from temporal subordination end-- freed from obligation, dancing as a witness to the unshrouding of the heavens.
