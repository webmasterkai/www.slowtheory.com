### Shuffling plans

Early in our discussions about possible post-wedding plans, I suggested to Michelle that we through-hike the Superior Hiking Trail. Despite numerous hiking and running trips, I have seen only about a third of the trail. What better time and circumstances would there be to fully immerse ourselves in it? That conversation faded off into something else, and we didn't give it further consideration until yesterday, when I found Michelle snooping through the Facebook photos of an individual who recently did the entire trail in 12.5 days. I've maintained that it's possible for us to do it in around two weeks. Michelle was suddenly open to the idea. We started talking about packing light, making use of the tarp shelter that she purchased last year and has yet to use, how to label boxes for the post office, and various other challenges imposed by the prospect of a trip by foot through rugged and remote wilderness. It was clear from our mutual energy that it was a thing that we could and should do. We hurried to REI. I wanted trekking poles as they would make our shelter easier to assemble, offer respite during two weeks of challenging hiking, and potentially serve a purpose during my upcoming 50 mile running race. The last 7 miles into Lutsen are very challenging, and I expect that I'll be just exhausted enough to benefit from them. It was a fun and impulsive afternoon.

### Shuffling my feet

While I've been logging a lot of miles in preparation for Superior, I've logged a lot of them slowly. That's not necessarily a bad thing, as even the *course record* is a 10min40sec pace, but I figured I ought to mix in a few legitimate running efforts to get myself prepared for the infrequent runnable stretches or the possibility of an epic sprint showdown for 52nd place.

For the second week in a row, Ken and I decided to go to the Mill City Friday morning group run. Despite feeling sluggish on the run to the store, I decided that I was going to try to stay with the front group as long as possible. It's the type of uncomfortable training that will eventually make me a better runner. My broken foot hates running hard on pavement, but eventually it will adapt, right?

The pace during the first part of the run was pretty easy. I was surprised to not be struggling to keep up. The group split slightly as we hit the Broadway bridge, but I was able to catch up as the bridge arched upwards. As expected, I struggled to keep up on the downhills, and felt *okay* on the uphills.

After crossing the bridge, I felt like the pace increased. I would later check Strava and find that our fastest mile was in this section at 6:58 min/mile. Nonetheless, I was close enough to the finish to feel good about putting in the effort to stay with the group. I'm sure that most of the people there were running casually, but I was thrilled to be able to hang even with an overall pace of 7:24.

The following day I went out for a 14.6 mile loop up the Diagonal Trail and back through northeast. I ran conservatively, but focused on consistent forward motion (i.e. not taking breaks or eatingâ€¦just plain water for the duration of the run). I finished with an 8:47 pace, incredibly hungry and electrolyte depleted. I was going to try to get in back to back 20s, but I'll probably just get in ten today and be content with a hard-run 42 mile week.

### Shuffling jobs

Last Wednesday was my last day at Cycles for Change. I will still assist them with a few computer related things here and there, but I turned in my keys and don't plan to keep regular hours there. While C4C was always viewed as a temporary position, it did feel odd to move on so quickly. There is a certain liberty in plans not necessarily happening as expected, and it will take my thinking brain a while to catch up to my instinctive brain. Shuffle
