2008 was a pretty good year for cycling. The first half of the year was somewhat lacking as I haphazardly prepared to run a marathon in June. Once autumn rolled around I started both riding more and enjoying riding.

Here are the numbers: 

### Total: 6339.47 miles

- January 257.79 
- February 234.30 
- March 303.22 
- April 649.59 
- May 471.90 
- June 610.27 
- July 604.50 
- August 476.70 
- September 861.00 
- October 888.40 
- November 565.80 
- December 416.00
