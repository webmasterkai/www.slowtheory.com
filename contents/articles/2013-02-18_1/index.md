Over the past month or so, I've tried to increase my running volume. It's been going pretty well. Last week I logged 39 miles, including a three day stretch at the end of the week during which I did 30 of those 39. *Repeated, cumulative effort.* The path to ultra-distance seems to be both re-arrangement of the senses and physical adaptation. The blogs of ultra-runners reflect certain, predictable differences:

* Ebb and flow, rather than consistent decline, of momentum.
* An uncanny level of *no-big-dealness* in the face of adversity.
* Willingness to be shaped by adventure.
* Redefinition of success and its corresponding benchmarks.

I have tried to adapt my mental approach to this philosophy of relentless positivity and engagement with my surroundings. A week ago Sunday Ken and I went down to the River Bottoms during a snowstorm. Big, wet, beautiful snowflakes clung to every surface and made even a ten minute mile a miraculous achievement. I loved being in the woods. I cannot even begin to describe it. We were five minutes removed from the suburbs, but it felt immense trudging around Long Meadow Lake. Breathe deep. Communicate. Learn. Live. The beauty of friendship with me, is that at some point you will find yourself slogging around Long Meadow Lake with me.

The following week I spent much of my time adapting to larger packs. Friday and Saturday I ran with my 25L Deuter Transalpine pack. It's not a particularly good running pack, and loaded with twelve pounds of food and clothing, I found myself bobbing back and forth like an awkward and ill formed toy. Nonetheless, I want to extend the range and capacity of my running, so it will be necessary to adapt. The Nathan Endurance pack that I purchased before the Winter Wilder is working out great, but it is limited. I can carry just enough food for a typical day, with no room for clothing or other necessary items.

On Sunday I got in a solid twelve mile run, heading west to the Sculpture Gardens and returning via the Greenway. It was an interesting route that I've never taken, and afforded me the opportunity to stop at the Freewheel on the Greenway around mile 9. I had a cup of coffee and a Lara bar. It rejuvenated me and made the final three miles quite pleasant.

Last week ended with almost 6 hours/39 miles of running. The previous week was around 5 hours/30 miles. The week before that was also around 6 hours/39 miles. These numbers are up markedly from December and January, when I was logging about 60-70% of the volume that I am now. If I can remain injury-free, it's looking like a good year.
