yesterday I spent most of the day certain that at some point I was going to *explode*. I decided that the best thing to do about it, beyond confronting the things that were happening inside of me, was a vicious after work session at the gym. I have been sporadic in my weight lifting for a while now, averaging no more than one trip per week. that's going to change. it's time to get serious. three times a week at a minimum and with greater intensity. my body was woefully unprepared for the energy that I brought with me. it wasn't long before my quivering limbs could do no more and I headed home.  
  
thursday night ryan brought over *the darkness*.

it was my first experience with the mythical darkness. it was good, but I'm glad that I didn't stand in line for four hours to get it.  
  
I'm trying to look more hip these days.
