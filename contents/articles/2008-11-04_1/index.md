…blog in my google reader reminds me to vote, I'm going to not vote just out of spite. I click from blog to blog with excitement and anticipation, thinking that I'll be treated to a new post only to find another devoid of content. Everyone who rides a bike and loves socialism reads the same twelve blogs. Is it really necessary for each of them to post a two line endorsement of our mostly flawed democracy? Now make no mistake, I don't mind reading a well written piece with substance that culminates in an a plea to vote. That's entertaining, even inspirational. Please internet, please either take the time and emotional energy to put some thought and imagination into your VOTE NOW posts or just don't post them. When you only post two or three words it comes out sounding hollow and crass. 

Oh yeah, and everyone should get out and vote for Obama (do you get it? I'm ironic like a mustache).
