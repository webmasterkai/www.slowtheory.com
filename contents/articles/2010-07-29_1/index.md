recollections from lake harriet/calhoun run:  
  
about two miles into my run I was about to cross paths with two runners while approaching a third when a large bug flew directly into my left eye. I flailed dramatically. one of the two women approaching me looked concerned and slowed her pace, presumably waiting to be sure that I would not simply collapse and die. to an observer the situation must have looked absolutely bizarre. I continued running with one eye mostly closed, trying to work the remnants of the insect from my eye with heavy handed prodding. as I approached another runner traveling the same direction I took to the dirt path at the edge of the trail in order to overtake her without interfering with oncoming pedestrian traffic. just I was about to pass I stepped on a pipe jutting rather randomly from the ground. my left ankle painfully rolled. I caught myself with my hand, but the commotion had attracted both her attention and the notice of the walkers traveling in the opposite direction. combined with my puffy, swollen eye I must have looked quite pathetic. I continued stoically, trying not to alter my stride in spite of the significant pain in my ankle.  
  
things improved as I approached calhoun. I received one of the most amazing smiles from a stranger that I've ever witnessed. it was *particular*. she was looking at me. it was not simply a smile meant to fulfill the obligation that strangers have of once in ten times noticing the person they are passing, but rather something provoked by the situation. as I continued I passed the beach area. an errant frisbee toss from a child rolled across the path. it was on end, rolling in a semi-circle. in one seamless motion I picked it up and made the perfect *frisbee toss*. the child looked delighted as he caught it. I was thrilled. it was a beautiful moment that is now impossible to describe with words. it is enough to say that it gave me faith in humanity, both my own and that which is external to me.  
  
earlier, as I was writing to a friend I stumbled upon an idea that seemed important. I will just paste it: "I've had a productive morning, cleaning my kitchen and doing my laundry. I like these things. I didn't realize that until I didn't do them for a long time. perhaps it is just a bizarre expression of ego: I like seeing my mark on my environment. I am not simply an autonomous thing existing within the confines of something external. instead my effusive glow glistens back at me from the 409 slicked surfaces and tells me that I am something large and demanding."  
  
finally, *the important thing*.  
  
breathe.  
  
*I am going to race the tour divide next year.*  
  
I have been contemplating the notion for the last several weeks. I realized that most of my reservations were not for the experience, but rather the logistics that will go into making a one month departure from everything a reality. I am fortunate to be in a position that I will come back to a job and the admiration and respect of my coworkers. this will be true whether I succeed or fail. it's absolutely life affirming. these people understand. most people are not in a situation where they could announce that they'd like to participate in a one month self supporter bicycle race and receive anything other than perplexed looks. I am lucky in that way.  
  
I have been riding more miles every year for the past five years. *training*. accumulating. it has never been for anything particularly focused. or maybe it has. maybe I have had an epic journey in the back of my mind each of those brutally cold days when I've found myself running alongside my bicycle, waiting for my feet to warm up. *why? why?? *freedom. the splendor of existing in a world that is so much greater and more impressive than the compartmentalized minutia of our daily lives. it begins today. july 29th, 2010.
