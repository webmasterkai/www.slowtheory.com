It is still feels a bit surreal, but Michelle and I recently put in an offer on a house near Prospect Park. After a bit of negotiating, the offer was accepted and we will close on it on August 31st. *Holy crap*. We love the house, it's a great time to buy, and circumstance dropped a great realtor/friend into our lap. There are still a few steps to be taken before the closing date, but unless disaster strikes or the inspector says *bad bad bad*, we should be sitting on our porch sipping tea before my 32nd birthday.

**Things we liked**

- Location. Although we had not originally considered the Prospect Park neighborhood, it ended up being a surprisingly exciting spot. I will be closer to work. This isn't particularly awesome, but in the context of *family life*, it will provide more flexibility than if I were dedicated to spending two or more hours on my bike everyday. I can always make my route longer, but not shorter. Additionally, we will be just over a mile from the Hampden Coop and 1.5 miles to the Seward Coop. Beautiful! The block we will be on is a one block wonder that dead ends and provides no purpose other than to those living on it. The proximity to the U of M transitway and bike lanes on 27th provide great transportation options. Finally, we are right near the light rail. I haven't checked to see where the nearest stop will be, but I expect it'll be less than half a mile  
- Kitchen. ...is just about perfect. The layout is very well done, with plenty of accessible counter space and a decent cabinets. The thing that really sets it apart is the walk in pantry that features additional counter space and shelving. For Michelle, this is exactly what she needs. The appliances are new, and I will have a dishwasher for the first time in a decade. It exits to the rear deck/porch thing, and will be delightful for outside summer dining.  
- Woodwork. The main floor needs to be stripped of an ugly, poorly applied layer of stain, but none of the main floor wood is painted and looks quite elegant, while maintaining a certain level of appealing simplicity.  
- Lots 'o bedrooms. There are four bedrooms on the second floor, and another in the finished attic. I'm not crazy about the attic bedroom, as it is not particularly well done (it could be revised to be an excellent space), but having so many rooms will offer plenty of opportunity for growth of our family and/or renters.  
Yard. The lot is kind of small, but there is still a very cozy backyard for fun, while the front yard looks like it will make a nice garden plot.  

Well, time to pack some stuff for move #1. I will have to move to Michelle's for the next month and a half, then on to move #2.
