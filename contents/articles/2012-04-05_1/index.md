![New frame bag for the crux](http://f.slowtheory.com/7048908009_d2fd823e90_n.jpg) In the period immediately following my finger injury, I desperately resisted the inevitability of a *diminished pace*. Things that were previously quite simple became frustrating and difficult. After a week of consistently failing to accomplish most things, I resigned myself to the necessity of taking a break. Physical activity was limited to things that lasted two or fewer hours and required no more than 70% intensity (as assessed in a purely subjective, *un-technical *way). I slept more, I scaled back my work tasks, and I was not shy about proclaiming any particular time of the night *bedtime*. After two weeks of this, I am just now starting to feel normal again. I am no longer a zombie. I can kind-of-sort-of move my finger again. Activity once again only hurts in the good way. Oh, and I got a couple teeth fixed (the last items on a list of neglected dental work), which has opened up the exciting possibility of chewing food with both sides of my mouth! Thrilling.  
  
Saturday is Bryce's birthday and we're going to celebrate it with a spirited mostly dirt century. I intend to use it as a test run for both gear and fitness for next month's [Almanzo 100][2]. My goal this year is to finish within an hour of Brandon. In 2010 (last year I went for the 162 mile course), I posted a time of 7h3m. I had a good first half of the race, but then struggled from overexertion and poor water/nutrition management. I spent 30 minutes at the forestville state park recovering before heading out for the final thirty miles. My fitness is better than 2010, so if I can avoid a 30 minute stop while moving only slightly faster, I think I can post a time of 6h20m, which I expect to be about 1 hour behind the leaders. That's assuming that the weather is beautiful and the roads are in fantastic condition. That probably won't happen. I actually wouldn't mind bad weather this year. Today I made a frame bag that can hold an almost full 70oz. camelbak bladder with enough room for food and tools, while still retaining one open water bottle mount. I'm toying with the idea of Hammer Perpetuem in the water bottle, water in the camelbak, and solid food in the remaining frame bag space. In reasonable weather conditions that would be enough to get me to the finish line. If it's warm, I'd need to refill the bladder. I'll test the setup this weekend and report back...you know, 'cuz I'm sure the interwebs is terribly concerned with my potential 62nd place finish in an unsancitioned, mid-west gravel tour-race-thing.
