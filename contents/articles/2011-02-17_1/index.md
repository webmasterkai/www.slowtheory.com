**Weather:** unseasonably warm. Temperatures were in the low forties with fog, mist and light rain.  
**Distance: **~16 miles  
**Time: **3 hours (including stops)    
**Notes:** I know how to ride a bicycle. I understand my limits (which are actually *almost* impressive), I know how to perform sustainably, and the outcome of any given ride is almost always just about what I would have expected. Running? Well...I am the Chazz of running. I don't know my limits, I don't know how to take care of myself during a run, the ebb and flow is completely unnatural, and I could *blow up dramatically* at any given moment.  
  
That was illustrated poignantly on today's run. I left the house hungry after eating only a small breakfast at Michelle's. No worries, I assured myself. Given nice weather, a slow pace and the opportunity to stop around mile 11 at a gas station I would certainly be just fine! The greenway was predictably dull and I felt lethargic and heavy-legged until mile five. From miles five to nine I felt great. After this I started to get really hungry and thirsty. The warm weather meant that I was sweating more than usual, and the prospect of finishing the run with only one potential water stop was a little bit unsettling. Nonetheless, I was thrilled when I made it to the SuperAmerica on the corner of Cedar and Minnehaha. I sat outside drinking chocolate milk and eating a donut. I knew that I must be in trouble if a donut seemed like a good idea in the middle of a run. My energy levels were very low.   
  
I started running again and felt much better. It didn't last though. Two miles later I was eying the puddle water thinking, "Should I drink this?" I didn't. Instead I was thirsty, hungry and my legs felt like lead. I began to move more slowly. The fog was actually a godsend because I couldn't look that far ahead. Lake Harriet could appear at any moment! Finally it did. I don't remember much about the last couple miles. I slowly dragged my body home. That's the gist of it. It was a poor performance. The combination of pushing the limits of my fitness and not planning well nutritionally meant that I crashed hard.   
  
Now I need to ask myself, "What would Chazz do?" He'd go out, just as mindlessly and ill prepared, and do it again in a week.
