(sunset on my way home from work)  
  
I didn't write anything in october. interesting. that has most likely never happened in the ten or so years that I've been distilling my thoughts on the interwebs. apparently I was busy, or apathetic, or just plain sleepy. it was an eventful month. a-train left the bike shop to pursue his framebuilding as a full time job. we've decided to get through the majority of the winter, and perhaps even the spring, without replacing him. consequently, I've spent a lot of time working. I haven't necessarily disliked it. I thrive most at work when I am challenged and that has not always been the environment at the bike shop. while the hours have sometimes been intense, the pace could best be described as *plodding*. this assertion might suggest a lack of passion, but I think it's quite the opposite: the environment has always been so humane, welcoming and free from the mechanized efficiency of the corporate world that it has been easy to simply *relax*. spiritually, this is wonderful, but it has not always solicited my best work. I am capable of more and now that the situation demands it, it is immensely satisfying to provide it.  
  
michelle has spent the month housesitting. this is twig:

I generally don't like cats, but twig is sort of amazing. he rings a bell when he wants to get in or out of the house, he fights other cats, and is warm/cuddly/friendly without being overbearing and obnoxious. unfortunately I am allergic to him, so I haven't been able to spend much time with cat or cat-sitter.  
  
over the weekend we went to ValleyScare. the weather was overcast and very few people were at the park. this meant that by mid-afternoon we had visited every ride at least once. we lazed about until early evening when the haunted houses opened and spent the next three hours meandering through various themed houses.

other things happened. some good. some bad. it's getting colder and darker. I am again in need of preparation. I need to pick an event and train for it. I contemplated briefly trying to get into the arrowhead, but it seemed too much and too expensive. triple d? a bunch of half marathons? I'm not sure. I know that next year I want to be more competitive in gravel events, but that is too far away to motivate me to get out and push myself as the temperatures continue to drop. think think think...
