I lapse into a kind of future stasis  
 all forgiveness already used up on me.  
Unkind warbles,  
  a modicum of well wishing intention  
and enchantment.  
bound to helpless passion  
 and fraudulent reason  
(a kind of love).  
misintention must surely be the word of the day.  
A few tracks  
where  
  one day the sun will warm the surface  
and the bare feet of the reaching virgin  
will dance  
  a kind of dance  
(a kind of love).  
Sun drenched in the never never,  
  already lost the sense of touch.  
A cave and a vault to commemorate a history of unkind passions  
(a kind of love).  
Freedom from the waking screams.  
Freedom from the passing songs  
  and the barefoot vixen, sundressed as a virgin.
