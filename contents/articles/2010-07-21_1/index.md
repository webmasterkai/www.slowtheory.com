it is morning. when I woke up something was not right. it was earlier than normal and my head was throbbing. I urinated and it felt like my body was trying to rid itself of something toxic. I thought about the previous day and possible explanations. *nothing*. I went to bed around the usual time and did not drink excessively. while dehydration could have been an explanation, my urine suggested otherwise.  
  
I went for a walk. I needed coffee and breakfast. I would normally have biked, but I thought a walk might jar my senses into normalcy. everyone was in a hurry. within a block I heard the unmistakable sound of flip flops approaching me from behind. I typically walk quite quickly so it is unusual that anyone passes me. she paused beside me, turned, *hello*, and continued on her way, getting into a car a half a block later. I felt slightly better. I spent a moment trying to decide whether I felt better because of the pleasant interaction with a stranger or because I was reminded that I was *not* in a hurry. I didn't have to scurry to an automobile and feverishly try to get myself somewhere in an impossible amount of time.  
  
lately I have been spending my time with other people. I have enjoyed it. I have felt better. I have accepted that I've been left standing here alone and that it's up to me to decide what happens now. I've cataloged a line from greenberg: *you're of value*. haha. it isn't exactly what you'd think just reading the words. it's a ridiculous thing to say when behavior makes it apparent. it's the ridiculousness of it that has lodged it in my mind.  
  
tomorrow starts a four day weekend for me. *it's time.*
