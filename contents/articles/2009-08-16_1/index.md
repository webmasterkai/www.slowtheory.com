I went for a walk this is not me around our this is me neighborhood. smelling. tasting. the wind was out of the south-southwest and the air was filled with this is not me moisture. the strange sensation of walking. I took her camera. as I walked I heard a phone ringing. it sounded just like mine. even though I knew that I wasn't carrying it I ran my hand over my pockets. no. not mine. it kept ringing, the intensity not changing in sync with my forward propulsion. time. an array of images passed through my mind. shifting. the moisture began to melt from the sky and into a light mist. I liked it at first. moving slowly. the streets were empty. the alleys were empty. I looked at things like I haven't before. at least not here. I crept around voyeuristically assessing my surroundings. interestingness. there is a lot of graffiti in my neighborhood. I photographed some of it, but much of it went only observed. as I walked down an alley a white cat pressed itself firmly into the ground. it was in the open area of a gravel driveway. not at all concealed. still it pressed itself to the earth, for warmth, for comfort. things like small spaces. I crouched, moved my body in ways that were unusual, childish. underneath trucks. down the railroad tracks. towards the city. away from the city. I was thinking. growing ideas and impressions of representations of reality altered only by a change in posture from erect to prone. the cat pressed itself against the ground as if I would not be able to see it. as I moved closer it fled, mismatched tail wagging behind it like accumulated, sinful baggage. the city loomed large against the backdrop of the dark, misting sky. the chance of rain for that particular hour was five percent. I walked home. noticing colors, thinking, "it is strange how the world that I know is largely dictated by my pace and objective." I do not drive a car. I do not currently drive a car. yet, I still move quickly through the world, nearly blind to the details that give dimension and purpose to the smallest of objects. you appreciate small things. no snicker. snickers bar. things linked loosely together by my own withered fairytales. framing trash. etc.

it is cooler now. almost perfect. the storm has passed and we are still here. holding hands.

4:33am

waking up.

we have a woodchuck in the yard. his name is george. sometimes I will see him standing up, observing. unafraid. the other day I walked into the kitchen, thrilled, childishly freaking out. he's out there. I see him! later. riding down the former bikelane on hennepin. there are no lanes now. cars going the wrong/right direction. taking over the bus lane. taking over the bikelane. nearing anarchy. george holds his ground, staring back at me intently. I stomp my feet. move. establish order. sentiment. I have written about this already, but until earlier today I had no idea what cold pressed coffee was. I googled it. this is what I do when I don't understand something: I read about it on the internet.

I don't know how to ride the bus. the only times that I've been on a city bus have been for the state fair. free. sit down. get up. get out. two stops. if it is flashing and on fire then it is the state fair. if it is dark and everyone around you is throwing up, then it is the parking lot. I intend to learn how to ride the bus very soon. it would be a wonderful skill to have. a year and a half ago when I was extremely ill with bronchitis I walked to work because my lungs couldn't handle the exertion of riding my bicycle. it was almost an hour walk each way. it would be three times longer from here. that won't be an option. so I went online to read about it. no, fuck you, tell me more. it didn't explain anything. "put some amount of money in a thing and sit your ass down unless the elderly have overrun the place." now listen to the smiths/the cure, wear mascara, and cry your fucking face off.

palindromes.

I stopped at the bank on my way home. the bank is in the grocery store. when I buy things at the grocery store I get eleven pieces of paper at the end of any transaction. coupons, receipts, gift receipts, proofs of purchase, more coupons, special offers, promotional materials, etc. the bank has started doing this. without any request I am handed a stack of pamphlets on savings accounts, IRAs, mutual funds, checking accounts, mortgages, and extortion. interesting. I put it in my bag and remind myself to shred it later. "just in case..." the weather was nice, except for the unceasing headwind. I leave for work in the morning and the wind is either negligible or from the north/south. I return home in the evening and it is almost always howling from the west. life, I guess. it was bright. I put on my sunglasses. helmet straps next to skin and glasses over straps. when I was younger it was opposite. someone told me that I should start doing it the other way. since then I have done it that way.

impressionable. one of my coworkers wrote "save" upside-down on a repair ticket and it looked like "anes".

what is the fucking price of postage these days?
