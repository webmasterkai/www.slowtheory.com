**First: finishing first** A couple weekends ago Bryce, Doug, and I went to the[ Dirty Lemming gravel grinder][1], a small event put on by one of Doug's friends. Last year, there were a dozen or so riders. This year roughly thirty made the start. I was 100% unprepared, and had absolutely no expectation other than finishing. We rolled out of Watertown as a group, but it wasn't more than five miles before Bryce and I were on the front doing that thing that we sometimes do when we ride together. With the group whittled to four, our fate was sealed: we would ride for the glory of *winning* a low key group ride attended by mostly fifty to sixty year old men. For a couple hours we just hammered, averaging nearly twenty miles per hour over loose gravel. I felt great, until I didn't. Around mile thirty-five we left the last remaining rider behind.* Bye Doug*. Then it was just me and Bryce, and I happened to feel like shit. "I feel like shit, sorry for not doing any work," I muttered as I tried to make myself small behind my lanky friend. This mostly worked. I didn't do anything. We pedaled into the wind. I planned my recovery. It was the crucial moment of deciding between recovery planning and fail planning. Failing seemed too logistically challenging, so I figured out how to recover: drink a bunch of water and eat something substantial at mile fifty. We made it to mile fifty, stopped briefly, and were back on the road with full bellies and conflicting ideas about the distance to our nearest "competitor".  
  
I slowly started to improve. I even took a few turns at the front. Then I improved more. By mile seventy I was feeling excellent. We were almost to the point where we would turn and have a tailwind for twelve or fifteen miles or something ridiculous like that. This was the first time that Bryce looked like shit. In a totally-not-evil-at-all kind of way, it made me feel good. Now I could do something to repay his efforts. We hammered the tailwind section and soon found ourselves within an hour of the finish. At that point, it doesn't matter. You're going to make it. We rode strong to the finish, making the decision to call it a *tie*. After working so effectively as a team for so long, it would have felt morally objectionable to sprint to the finish. I almost always beat him in sprints, but he could have crushed me earlier in the day. Whatevs. Sadly, there was only one trophy for the winner, so it was awarded to me since the ride favored the older gentleman. Bryce took home the "Best Young Rider" trophy, but in my mind this thing belongs to both of us.

Finishing first was fun. It really made me wish that I was the sort of impressively fit individual who could dream to do that in a more competitive event.  
  
**Second: finishing, period. **The Superior trail marathon, or Moose Mountain marathon, is just over three weeks away. Since I haven't really done any training, I figured I ought to go for a run today. The weather forecast was: "bliss". It was cool, cloudy at times, with a wind that didn't seem to bother me more than once, and only for a few short seconds. The route was my new favorite long run--around the airport via Fort Snelling and the National Cemetery. It was roughly the same route as my Memorial Day marathon training run, but with a couple unintentional additions. I felt awesome coming out of Fort Snelling. It was the first long run I've ever done on the road in Hokas, and it was awesome. As gaudy, and visually offensive as I find the things, they work well for my broken sesamoid. Sidenote: orthotics were a bit of a flop. They caused knee pain, and felt too rigid and restrictive. Had I discovered Hoka One One prior to getting them, I probably wouldn't have even pursued it. My feet feel fantastic, but without compromising letting them do their thing. End sidenote.  
  
The stretch around the southern end of the airport and up Longfellow was, as always, the worst. I didn't feel terrible, but it's an uninspiring vista of modern man's "accomplishments". I.e. a harrowing look into the mechanical excess of our fast paced, beauty-be-damned existence. In a way, it's the perfect wasteland for solitude, completely devoid the consequences of wonderment. Oops. Riffing. Anyway, I felt good. I stopped at Target and bought an orange juice. Strangers offered bemused or critical looks. I smiled and bounced through the aisles in my silly shoes, unintentionally bobbing in such a way as to mimic covert skipping.  
  
Leaving Target I started to feel more tired. This was not unexpected as I've run very little since the Afton Trail run five weeks ago. It was okay though. The psychology of the long run has changed for me. I was able to go into the last five miles knowing that I'd be fine. I'd complete almost nineteen miles with almost zero training and probably feel pretty good about it. In previous years, I would have been freaked out about the fact that I skipped the first twelve weeks of "a good training program". Instead I have been relying on diversity of activity and knowing how to better communicate with my body. I certainly got tired, but I finished strong.  
  
**Third: starting. **I have started practicing SWIMMING. I joined the YMCA and have been sporadically hitting the pool in the morning. I am still at the level of your lower tier seven year old, but I'm working through a lifetime of fear and trauma. The form will come. The rhythm will come. I don't intend to pursue this doggedly until the winter, but it's good to start building the foundation. One of my goals for next year is to complete a triathlon of any length.
