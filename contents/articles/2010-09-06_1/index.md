absolute tranquility was achieved. facing about to the dark skies pressing in, synthesizing my forward motion with the bending of the corn stalks and the rearrangement of the leaves on the ground. fall. autumn. loose dirt and rain. wind. for hours I swear I didn't see another human being, mixing emotions with friendly and unfriendly animals running along the roadside bemoaning my relevance. at that unexpected moment the skies let loose and swallowed up, engulfed, bled all over me until the two of us were inseparable. I talked to cows just to hear my voice. hahaha. how I laughed! how I took pleasure in finding myself tiptoeing through this barren, unknown, landscape.  
  
*presque vu*.  
  
I had a lovely lunch near some lake or another. absolutely lovely. chocolate milk, an orange and a sandwich.  
  
by far my favorite solo 100 miler in the wind and rain on my thirtieth birthday, ever.
