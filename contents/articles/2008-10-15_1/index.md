I feel myself growing older  
dumber  
vaguer  
perpetually, eventually fearful  
of dying  
getting too fat  
eating too much mercury  
and maybe that's what's happening  
as my hands lose their  
ability to make fine deft maneuvers  
across a woman's chest  
or along my own skin  
grossly gelatinous  
and terminally awkward  
I am no longer impressed  
with great literature  
unless I force exclamations  
proclaiming unseen brilliance  
in something whose  
clarity  
was fostered not  
in the early morning hours  
of devouring with my eyes  
but rather  
in the vacant murmurs  
of internet and starlight  
ha ha  
my pornography  
is learning what other people  
find intelligent  
insightful  
evocative  
and then recouping my lost brains  
by saying  
I think what they think  
that vague shiftless  
mass  
and in these  
my "late years"  
(I'm almost thirty, almost twenty-nine)  
I have become an intellectual  
hobo  
hopping trains of another person's thoughts  
spydropping  
on the eve  
of complete psychological meltdown  
...and "her"  
naughty girl  
wanting  
as evidence of my sinful mediocrity  
so that she can point  
and laugh  
meditatively  
(like an adult)  
without childish judgment  
(completely like an adult)  
and feel vindicated  
although not in the way of the immature  
it's merely a matter of record  
ha ha  
and instead of saying I'm sorry  
begging  
acting out of character  
I might take an equally mediocre lover  
just for habit
