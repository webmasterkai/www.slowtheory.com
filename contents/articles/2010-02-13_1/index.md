I have been out of sync lately. I have not been sleeping well or experiencing the same level of intensity while awake that I would expect. it is almost as if my dreams and reality were temporarily switched. this morning I woke up and everything felt normal again and could not remember anything about my dreams other than that they were. I typically experience a very narrow range of human emotion. whether flaw or attribute, the entire weight of my humanity is pressed into this small space, with the result that I experience within that range a level of uncanny intensity. at times it is sickening. I do not want to feel with such overabundance that I lose hold of my faculties. all of them. I experience stoic distraught. however, lately it has been difficult to distinguish one from the other. during the day I experience with psychological graininess, phasing in and out of the concreteness that dictates reality from unreality. I have to go to work now. I think.
