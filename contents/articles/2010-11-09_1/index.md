bryant lake bowl. monday night. the equity of this conversation about the equity of interaction *hatched* by the resolute newness of frivolity, inasmuch as *frivolity *is defined by the necessity and brevity of interactions. the balance was neither impeded or amplified by the presence of a beer described by nature as indulgence rather than spiritual sustenance. I can tell: we are complex people. we were complex people. this, of course, bred by the sheer unexpectedness of sitting down with a stranger and accessing and allowing the access thereof. energetic, but not false, revelation stirred/enticed by the reality that you are in the company of a mind capable of thought-making and thought-receiving. the glasseye dullness of regularity naturally circumvented by the allowance of the other as an animate and animated thing. *refined people.* of course when I returned to THE RADIO there was the most delightful song. I sunk into the couch in the state of reverie that accompanies sincere contemplation and felt something on my skin that, in spite of its complete unreality, expressed all of the characteristics of a distinctive texture. and then I went to bed.
