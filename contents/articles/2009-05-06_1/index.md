It is morning. Dreams of melting wax--pretty, reshaped me. Staring off into the yester-sun with glistening new eyeballs. I have been exhausted and mentally bankrupt, seldom inspired to create or absorb. I assess by picture, proof of passing time, giving and taking almost nothing to/from my immediate surroundings. I exist isolated in my own mind. Have I invented this dark center of the universe? Hah ha. Talking to myself. Murmuring brutality. Sip coffee. Invoke Routine. "Pretty young thing of my mind's dereliction..." and it is as if I am blithely shuffling heel-first into the future. "I sin for you." Simply. Take a shower and become a collection of new smells.

Strictly speaking, it is 6:54am. Today's plan: wait for tomorrow.

Seasonal allergy season. It's gotten shorter as I've grown up, become MAN, but still there are weeks when I sniffle, dripping red eyes squinting to re-conceive what was first invented in my mind and then projected into the earth. Yesterday after blogging about the ladder near my window I came out of my bedroom to find a man suspended outside of my window. He watched me while I opened the refrigerator door and closed it again. We pretend as though we do not see each other. This is not a problem. This is what we (anybody) would do if we met in the street. Ignore. Pass by. False language. Guidelines.

Part of the challenge is figuring out how to hone in on the subterranean layer of truth that recedes/supersedes the endless artifice. Do I really feel this way? Do I think these things? And it comes out as inconsistency. Lovers quarreling because I/you seem inconsistent. Hah! You/I should be flattered! It means that there is truth mixed with the perpetual falsity, the endless sequence of mirrors that reproduce flawless visions of perfectly shaped fruit: apples not marred by bruises, lopsidedness, parasites, or discoloration.

Pitter patter. It stormed yesterday (heart beats faster). Abrupt, coinciding with my own flight home. Alternating paths of violent self-purging. Thunder, lightning, the entire untapped reality of it. (I am knife edge)

Now starts...another day. Sigh.
