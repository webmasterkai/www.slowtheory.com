it and I different fading pulsing drizzling into passivity of days growing shorter the darkness creeping into the regularity and becoming a thing into which I pour sensation focusing pinching my eyes to focus beyond its limitations beyond the scope of a thing perfectly conceived in imaginary space of and into the corporeal for instance the mark on my shin where I last deformed stretched maladjusted misproportioned my body conceptually as it pertains to spatial congruency and the flow of emotional evidence into from and with the thing in my dreams that follows in spotlit fantasy distortions of property including skin tone dimension pliability maximally contained in edifice or scampering in dreams two we yes I see from lightness to darkness following unrestrained from space to space essentially familiar but composed in alternately as thing and unthing the bedroom only turned slightly on end and believed to be heinous in its corners because of the lost light and day fades into night taking with it the high temperament of thinking loving believing and leaving at most the fitful paranoid sleep that comes to us in panoramic visions of self composed previousness blood on the porcelain walls in rewind the composition of images all from a static position as it pertains to color and imagination leaving only for the strategic manipulation of cropping oneself living in distortion fortifying a healthy sense of self in the identification and rejection of sympathetic thoughts stripping the rational redundancies of contemplating fate from a more objective mindset for instance I think that last night I had two dreams containing things that had everything to do with me but perhaps my mind was infiltrated with images blending from she to me to she.
