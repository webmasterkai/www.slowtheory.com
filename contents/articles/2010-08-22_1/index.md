I haven't been riding as frequently or as seriously on sunday. I've taken a break for *life*. Today I decided it was time to make my return to long, grueling sunday riding. I couldn't find any one person or group of people to join me for the day, so I split the day into halves. The first half consisted of meeting Chaes and some dude from Akron, Ohio at the bike shop for a road ride "to the north". Mike, the mysterious stranger from Akron, was a very good rider. I found out in our conversation that he's qualified for and competed in the Boston marathon multiple times. That, of course, meant that he was fast. We went up near Bald Eagle Lake, to Hugo, and then back to Saint Paul. It was a pretty hard ride with just enough conversation to make it enjoyable. My average speed on my computer when I returned home was almost 19mph. I was tired, but in fifteen minutes I needed to meet Ryan and Joey for the second half of the day.  
  
The second half of the day was not nearly as *automatic.* We stopped numerous times. I needed food at one point as I was teetering on the brink of a hunger/dehydration bonk. After eating I felt much better and thought that the rest of the day was going to be wonderful. Unfortunately that's when I started getting flats. The first was mostly my fault as I took a very poor line over the railroad tracks. This was followed within forty-five minutes by two others that were not at all my fault. After running out of tubes and being forced to patch one the flatted tubes I decided that I needed to call it a day. Ninety-one miles. Moderately uninteresting riding. Fun and rewarding spending time with friends. Joey purchased his first road bike just this year, and not only has he shown quite a bit of skill, he seems to be enjoying it a lot. Cool.
