After logging a lot of miles in the past week, I decided to keep it low key this morning and just do a couple laps at wirth. Snow conditions were fantastic. A lot of people have been out since Sunday and I felt almost silly rolling on such fat tires. I wasn't riding very hard, and still managed lap times that were at least one and a half times as fast as Sunday. I started behind someone on 2.something tires and didn't even catch him. It was fast. After two laps on the north loop I thought I'd check out the south loop. Surprisingly, there was not a single track since the last snowfall. There were clearly tracks made between the first and second snowfall, but not many. It was mostly rideable, but much slower and more difficult. I should go back and make some tracks before it's ruined by deer, dog and people tracks. On the way home I got a friendly honk from a car with a mountain bike on its roof rack. A couple blocks later a glenwood street thug told me, "If you run into me with that bike, I going to take it." I said, "what's that?" He repeated it as I passed. I laughed. He laughed. I thought it was mostly a fair agreement. I think it should extend to cars.
