Reactions were mixed when I informed my coworkers that I'd convinced Bryce to do a 20 mile run at the River Bottoms with me. Some people thought I was a jerk, while others knew that I simply didn't know any better. Despite recently acquired anecdotal evidence to suggest otherwise, I steadfastly adhere(d) to the notion that any willing, physically fit person is capable of running twenty miles, if paced appropriately. In short, go the proper degree of fastand you can get really far. See?  
  
So we met up at some point in the morning, rode really slowly for an hour, and then traded our bikes for shoes. Normally I do not run with any techy gizmos, but since I wanted to be sure that we did not try too hard, I was equipped with a GPS and a heart rate monitor. The first mile was almost entirely sand. Given the terrain, I was expecting roughly ten minute miles and a heart rate barely inching into zone three. That seemed 'safe'. Five minutes in, we were on pace for an 8m30sec first mile. I felt fine, but I knew we shouldn't go that fast. I did the responsible thing: I made us slow down. From here, we settled into a nice rhythm. The terrain became firmer and more consistent, my heart rate remained in zone three, and our mile splits were about the same.  
  
After crossing the raft, Bryce expressed a peculiar concern. He suggested that he might not be able to finish the run. I scoffed. I was filled with a mixture of disbelief and dislike. As if bartering with a child, I proposed eating disgusting amounts of fast food at the midpoint. We kept running. By the end of the seventh mile, however, it was clear that Bryce was done. He asked to walk. I said, "sure." We were out of water, so the decision was either a.) walk for two hours back to the bikes without water, or b.) walk through the suburbs in search of Chipotle.  
  
While we were walking through the suburbs, Doug called for an unrelated reason, but quickly offered to pick us up and give us a ride back to our bikes. We met at Chipotle, ate lunch, and then returned to the spot where I was sure we'd left the bikes. We ambled into the woods. Doug returned to his life. Something did not seem right. We were on the wrong side of Long Meadow Lake. We discussed a variety of dangerous, sketchy options before settling on a walk around the lake. I wasn't thrilled with the idea, but I also wasn't bothered by it. We traded shoes and were off.  
  
The walk ended up being seven miles. We hopped on our bikes, picked up the lightrail, and returned to Minneapolis. In the end, it was an 8.5 hour, multi-modal adventure. Sometimes things don't work out the way you expect. It was fun.
