it is morning. new computer. the keyboard is small and makes sounds like I am furious. no, it's just that the space bar is out of sync with the other keys. the plodding deep regression. savage. click harder. normalize volumes. there is no coffee here this morning. damn. yesterday was the last day to move everything out of the old apartment. in the morning the general and I hauled over the final load. things that have no relevance to my life. things that I've lived without for the past six weeks in relative comfort and happiness. junk. shit. I didn't want it to be this way. it'll disappear, seep into the cracks of my life. after a while I won't even know that it's there. new desk. at an angle. charming postural proposition. sit like this. it was a beautiful night last night. I sat on the porch and waited for fireworks. make me calm. make this calm. they didn't happen. I just clicked on the forecast. shit. fuck. augustmotherfucker. here's an update of what I have and have not been doing: ...

I ate at pizza luce with b, c, and my parents. lunch. content. then the car. slightly less content. then the mall. much less content. then the car. a bit more content, but still discontent. then ikea. very discontent. queasy. ill. how the fuck do people do this? then more car. then cleaning. then home.

I'm sure that I saw something interesting.

I'm sure that it's time to leave for work.
