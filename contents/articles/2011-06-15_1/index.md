*Happy thing #1*. Last Saturday Michelle and I went to the Surly brewery tour. We rode our bikes. The weather was immaculate. After the tour we went bikexploring and stopped at Anchor Fish and Chips for dinner. We sat on the patio and allowed the beauty of the day to further penetrate.  
  
*Happy thing #2:* This weekend we're going on a bicycle tour that will visit three state parks and cover 270 miles. Michelle will ride her new and improved touring bike.  
  
*Happy thing #3:* I am moving soon. In spite of being accosted for previous posts indicating that I would remain steadfast in my resolution to find *just the right place*, I did just that. Fortunately happenstance allowed me to find that place before the end of June. It's a quaint little 4plex with porches and yards and things like that. It's also within walking distance of Michelle's and $200/month cheaper than my current place.  
  
*Happy thing #4:* Had a very nice dinner on Monday night with Joey and Ryan at Ecopolitan.  
  
*Happy thing #5:* We got a [new bike shop trailer][1] (we got the longer one) that I'll be able to use for moving. We'll also be renting it out, so if you're thinking of moving by bike it'll be a great option.  
  
*Happy thing #6:* If everything goes as planned moving will include a larger, upgraded bed. zzzzZZZZ
