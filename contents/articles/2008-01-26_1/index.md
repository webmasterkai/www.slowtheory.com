She thought of disappearing quietly, ebbing away in that moment when her presence mattered so little. One day her slight form was seen moving nearly invisibly along a residential boulevard, materializing almost transcendentally for the viewer--a woman not much unlike herself, except younger and with color in her face. The one was no less startled than the other, and for a length of time they stood as if motion was the means by which their outlines were constructed. However, once into the foreground, an object rarely recedes into the background without another taking its place, and as they stood facing each other no such thing occurred. Finally the one smiled. The other made a hesitant movement forward. 

My long runs are starting to get interesting again. I'm straying from the isolated confines of my immediate neighborhood and studying people as they move. The girl with white boots refused to pivot her head. It held atop her bouncing form as a balloon might from the hand of a child, its motion delayed and dampened, curiously abstract in its incongruity. It was night, of course, and the combination of sweat and moisture made me concerned that I might be at risk for hypothermia. I tried to assess various complex ideas, assuring myself that as my core temperature decreased I would grow confused and irritable. I thought about removing a layer, or perhaps rotating them so as to try to get the most dry near my skin. My hands were not cold, but the sensation in my forearms was dulled to the point of numbness. I continued because the circumstances could not be altered. The run was only eight miles, but I will need a better strategy next time--most likely stopping at home midrun to change baselayers. I got home, fumbled with the key, eventually gripping it with both hands to produce the force necessary to turn it in the lock.
