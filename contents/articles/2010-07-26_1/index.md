*friday night*: she asks me from across the table, "are you okay?" the concerned look on her face transforms into perplexity. *what is wrong with you?* we were sitting outside. the temperature was a relatively cool seventy-five degrees. twenty minutes into the meal I realized that I'd overestimated my ability to withstand what I had deemed a conservative choice of curry. my hair was slicked with sweat and as I tried to casually wipe it away I did nothing but mold the damp mess into an increasingly hideous mess. to further highlight my embarrassment my glasses began to fog and my water glass was magically refilled after drinking no more than a third of its contents. "are you sure you're okay?" haha. it was a delightful situation. while half of my consciousness struggled trying to force myself to lower my core temperature by nothing more than the will of my mind, the other half tried to engage in a conversation that would hopefully deflect notice until the former had the situation under control. it didn't work. I looked foolish. it was fun. my companion was gentle enough with it and a walk to the video store confirmed that embarrassment is survivable.  
  
*later*: the movie. we selected *brief interviews with hideous men*. I wasn't expecting much. I was only attracted by the prospect of hideousness (a kind of beauty). immediately it became apparent that I was watching a different kind of film. it seemed like a less sophisticated version of synechdoche, new york. it lacked the breadth, imagination and expansiveness, but nevertheless wove itself cleverly and carefully through a myriad of sensations. I love when films demand experience through sensation rather than accumulation of plot details.  
  
*saturday*: woke up. breakfastcoffee and then meeting with three friends for a tour of the summit brewery. I didn't pay close attention during the tour, instead busying myself taking photographs and contemplating the free beer that would be served at the conclusion. it did not disappoint.

after the brewery tour we went back to joey's. after a brief stop at angry catfish for a mind boggling cup of coffee, I was introduced to the game of *bag toss.*

the rest of the day brought more drinking, night time wii, more bag toss, and listening to strangers tell stories. I had a surprisingly good time and didn't get home until quite late.

*sunday:* woke up early to meet ryan and alex motherfucker at the bike shop for a ride around afton. it was difficult to rouse myself from slumber so early in the morning, but having suggested the meeting time and place it was no less than an obligation. the first two hours of riding were a bit of a buzzkill. I wasn't awake, I was possibly still a little bit drunk, and the direction that we did the route had the least interesting parts happening first. once we made it to the afton area I started to feel much better. we stopped for a snack. as we were getting ready to leave I ran into a customer from the bike shop. he's one of my favorite customers and it was fun to see him outside of work. we rode a few more hills and went home.  
  
in the evening I did some stuff. this included being treated to pizza luce. fuck yeah. it's been a long time since I've eaten pizza, but I thought the time on the bike warranted a bit of an indulgence.  
  
*monday:* nothing special. work. race home with alex motherfucker and big-d. 32.5mph sprint on a 42 x 17 gear. that's 167 rpm. self declared *winner*.  
  
*tuesday*: taco night with new friends? I sure as fuck hope so.
