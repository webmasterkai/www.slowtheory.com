Over the weekend I got in my last training run for Superior. I might still go out for some 2 and 3 mile jaunts before Friday, but mostly it's done. My preparation feels good. I'm coming into the race around 157 pounds, which is a few pounds heavier than last year and several pounds above my target race weight, but the rest of my training has gone well. Sure, I have had some disastrous training runs, but I've been logging the distance, getting faster, feeling more comfortable, and gaining valuable information about how to fuel for the race. I've completed six marathons or ultras this year, finishing three of them feeling strong, while learning valuable lessons during the others.

We were in Indiana to attend the wedding of one of Michelle's cousins, but it worked out well that we could spend the first night and following morning traipsing around a nearby state forest. We'd followed the ridiculously hot weather from Minnesota, and spent the majority of Saturday sweating and then hiding from storms. Perseverance yielded a beautiful, cool, slightly humid Sunday morning. I woke up shortly after sunrise, grabbed a water bottle, and ran to the trailhead just a half mile away. I was a little bit nervous about navigation, so I chose the 3 Lake Trail, which seemed a little more navigationally forgiving than the other 10-12 mile loop that wound through the *backcountry*. 

A couple miles in, I almost got lost following a dried up riverbed, but was soon back on course and feeling more comfortable with the trail markings, which were generally quite good once you had a sense of when and where you would find them. The beautiful sunrise slowly evaporated the mist that clung to the trees from a night of continuous rain, producing an eerie fog that I found both peaceful and spooky. I passed by a cemetery, a dried up lakebed, and soon found myself skirting along a narrow section of trail above the lake where I hoped to refill my water bottle. Unfortunately, there was no pump or running water, so I just kept moving. I'd conserved about half a bottle, so I felt comfortable going into the last part of the run. It was a very runnable trail--smooth, fast, and with elevation that came in tolerable doses. It was the perfect course for a medium effort, medium distance run. I returned to camp in just under two hours feeling very satisfied and ready to face the day.

We drove to Terra Haute to set up at our next camping location and then rendezvous with the a large group of Michelle's extended family. The wedding would be in the evening. We weren't as thrilled for our second night of camping, which would be at a park just outside of Terra Haute. While our fears of an urban, parking-lot converted into a campground were far from the truth, it did end up being *weird.* The initially charming old woman who checked us in quickly transitioned from sweet and charming to creepy and intrusive. The check-in process dragged on for twenty minutes and required that we give a detailed account of where we would be spending our time and when we would be returning. The subsequent drive through the area revealed a strange collection of permanent and semi-permanent residents who met our friendly smiles and helloes with scowls that begged *WTF are you doing here?* At this same time, we received a text from Michelle's brother saying that he had extra space in his motel room. We decided to donate our $12 to the weirdness and spend the night in a motel.

Weddings can be rather traumatic events for introverts…I mean, *real introverts*,  not the ones who claim introvertedness based on the occasional desire to chill out and watch a movie. No, I'm talking about the kind of people (like me!) whose mental and emotional faculties are dulled to the point of stupor by the din of a room full of people doing nothing more than engaging in the contrary act of being extroverted. Oh, how I try! I like Michelle's family, and I think it's wonderful to spend time with them, but to perpetually do so in the most unflattering light further heightens an anxiety bred naturally by the chemical composition of my brain in that space. Anyway, I don't do well at weddings, and there is little to no sympathy for it. Expressing such a thought is met by extroverts with phrases like, "Oh, you just have a bad attitude!" The truth is that they couldn't possibly understand. Subsequent efforts to work against your natural inclination are met with the most ingratiating bullying tactics. "See, wasn't that fun?" …like you're some kind of child who simply doesn't know what is best for himself. 

Anyway, I digress. The point is this: it was a wedding that everyone seemed to enjoy immensely, and seeing Michelle and her family enjoying the event was truly touching. I am certain that the bride and groom are destined for a happy future, and that little could have been done to make for a better evening. My own role was one of trying very hard to fit in, but ultimately finding myself the shy and awkward person that I necessarily become in those situations. 

I enjoyed the trip home. We walked from the Franklin Station, kicking around some of the details of our attempted through-hike of the SHT in October before stopping at the Seward Cafe for a late lunch. While we ate we talked about the future and then enjoyed the remainder of the walk home in perfect weather. It was an unexpected and delightful afternoon.
