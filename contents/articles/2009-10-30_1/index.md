this has been a very different October. different than...everything. dreary. dreamy. rainy constantly. I woke up late this morning. 9am. irritability was setting in because I hadn't had coffee. it was visually disorienting to look at the blinds and see only muted, imaginary light. I ate my breakfast. I assessed. played. indulged in foolishness. it was raining, so I decided that I would go for a long run. temperatures were in the low fifties and the rain was light. terrible for most things, but lovely for running. the route that I had conceived in my head was to run down glenwood, along the creek, through the golf course, down wirth parkway, around brownie lake, returning via the cedar lake trail and bryn mawr meadows. based on the number of miles I have been running it was an ambitious plan. I was surprised because I felt wonderful. it was both pleasant an uneventful, a perfect way to relax and shake off the vaguely stressful sensation that plagued my morning. I did not feel even remotely tired until I reached the cedar lake trail, and even then it had more to do with my proximity to home than anything else. later I went to the grocery store, played on the computer, ate snickers bars, took pictures.
