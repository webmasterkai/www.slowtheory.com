I've finally relented and made an appointment to have my tooth fixed. It broke sometime over the summer and I have been stricken with periodic bouts of pain since then. Most of the time it has been quite bearable, but there have been a few days during which I have found myself glassy eyed and sniffling, wanting nothing more than to separate myself from the frailty of my body. 
 
I have been trying to ride my bike more. Last month was rather horrifying in that regard, and I fear that I let the summer slip away, untouched by my dirty greedy hands. I've been riding the crosscheck most days, letting it know that due to a number of financial stresses--­impending dental work being one of the more prominent--­I have been forced to sell my road bike, thereby consolidating commuter, bad weather bike, and road bike all on to its stalwart frame. My Independent Fabrication is on ebay and will be missed greatly, but life beckons. During my ride the other morning I watched the odometer on the crosscheck tick over to 500 miles. 

Tomorrow will be the second to the last long run of my marathon training. At this point my strategy has been fully realized and there is little I can do beyond going through the motions of completing this last month of training. Tomorrow will be the first run over twenty miles. I will start to get a feel for what the final hour of running will feel like. I anticipate that my marathon time will be rather slow, but my confidence in completing it has grown by leaps.
