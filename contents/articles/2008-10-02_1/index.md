Last night we went on our first of what will surely be two or three Wednesday night longtail rides.

Lately I've been feeling unaffectionate towards the Big Dummy, so it was good that I was forced into riding it. There's nothing sadder than an unridden, expensive bike. The ride started ominously enough as a motorist didn't like that I turned with traffic, which is funny because taking the full lane rather than turning alongside traffic would seem to be much more of a burden. So long as the motorist doesn't want to take a bizarre, meandering line through the corner it would seem that both vehicles could turn at the same time. This particular time though, the motorist's brain short circuited and it was the cause of an unpleasant stir of emotions. 

Once we were on the transitway things continued their disastrous trend. I turned at one street, most everyone else turned at another street and Alex and Nathalie were caught in between, losing sight of both parties. I was by myself so I decided to loop around looking for any of the six people I'd lost. I settled for finding Tom. We continued to the meeting point of Pizza Luce where we met up with Dave, Maria, and Matt. "Where's Alex and Nathalie?" Dave asked me. Uh... 

They were lost somewhere on University. I felt bad because I knew that of all of the people to get separated from the group they were the least equipped to find their way to the restaurant. I wanted to go look for them, but Alex wouldn't answer the phone to tell me what cross street they were at. We ordered beer while we waited. Much to my relief they arrived safely only a short time later. 

From here things got better. The pizza was delicious. I haven't eaten pizza since sometime in July, so it was a rare treat. I can't make a habit of it if I want to get to marathon weight. I only lost a couple pounds in September. I need to get back on track here soon if I expect to be light enough in the spring to smash my mediocre personal bests. 

After we finished eating we headed over to Town Hall Brewery. I've never gone inside before. It was weird, much different than the patio. I didn't like the setting, but their stout is one of my favorite beers of ever. Upon arriving we had locked up next to another Big Dummy. The guy who owned it came up to our table and said, "I was unlocking my bike and I was like, HOLY FUC K! Are you breeding?" We talked briefly and he went on his way. Another carfree big dummy rider. Awesome. We left Town Hall and headed towards Longfellows. I was pretty sure that they didn't have nightlife, but Tom thought otherwise. We got there and they were closed. Matt and I broke off and headed for home.

This morning after shaking the cobwebs out of my head I decided to ride Karate Monkey v2 to Theodore Wirth for some mountain biking. The Karate Monkey isn't the best mountain bike in the world, but given the thirty miles to ride there and back it was well suited to the journey. The weather was about perfect and the trail was in great shape. It took me a while to get used to the drop bars and lack of suspension. Wirth isn't a very technical trail, but the last time that I was there I was riding a dual suspension five inch travel bike. As I started to get acclimated to it I found myself having more fun. What had been a pretty dull trail on my full suspension bike was a lot more challenging on my rigid 29er touring adventure whatever bike. My only complaint was the low handlebars. I need a new fork with more steerer. I had to spend most of my time on the hoods when being in the drops would have offered greater control.
