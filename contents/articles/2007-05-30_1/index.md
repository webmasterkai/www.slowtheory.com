I just woke up from a bizarre dream. I was in a former russian torture facility. There were swinging stainless steel wall cabinets that housed corpses. The corpses had been removed but I recalled them in a flashback (if one can have such a thing whilst dreaming). The facility was maze-like and there were no windows. I had the feeling that it might have been underground. I was staying there with a number of women and a handful of men. I was anxious. I went to the room of one of the women to ask her for a list of books that I should read. From the door I could see three women, none of whom I feared and one of which was the friend I had come to visit. I opened my mouth to speak and a fourth woman popped up from under the blankets on the bed and interrupted me. She spoke gently to the woman I was addressing and harshly towards me. She told me to sit. I was afraid of this woman so I did as she instructed, sitting cross legged in front of the open doorway. I left without saying anything more. In the hallway I was face to face with a man with very dark features, black hair speckled with bits of gray, and a neatly trimmed goatee. The pupil and iris of his eyeballs nearly blended into one vacuous space. I could not discern where it was coming from, but someone yelled, "someone here really is [indistinguishable russian name]." In my dream I recognized the name as the man who had operated the torture facility before its conversion to an asylum. The man smirked at me and I had the distinct notion that I was the russian man and everything was about to go terribly wrong for me.
