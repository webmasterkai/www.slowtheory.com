 We stopped at another gas station in Danbury. I called Dave to let him know that we were running behind schedule and that the outlook of arriving in a timely fashion was looking bleak. *Evening, *I said, *we'll be there sometime in the evening*. As we started out of town I once again tucked in behind Jeff. The wind was fierce and even with Jeff and his superhuman fitness taking the force of it we were seeing speeds between 13-15mph. Normally on pavement Jeff would be doing 20+ and I would be merrily tucked in his centaur-shaped shadow.

This went on for a while until we found ourselves inadvertently crossing the Saint Croix and heading back into Minnesota. We'd missed our turn. Backtracking didn't take particularly long, but we did have to climb up a moderately steep hill to get to the junction at the top of the hill. "County road H" started innocently enough with a bit of rough pavement followed by a transition to gravel. I wasn't expecting gravel, but upon seeing it a brief moment of joy hit me as I'd grown tired of riding the shoulder of a heavily traveled paved road. There would be little traffic and we were both riding cyclocross bikes....the sort of thing you'd expect to need on a gravel road.

Within a mile the gravel got more challenging. Within another mile the gravel turned into sand.

By this point we were either traveling about 5-8mph in an awkward, calorie consuming zigzag or we were walking. I had a slight advantage with my lower gearing and tubeless tires, but we both were hurting (once we started exclusively walking Jeff had the advantage with better weight distribution on his bike and more natural walking ability). As we continued riding became infrequent. We were mostly walking, trying to reach an inn that was supposedly just up the road where we hoped to run into another road or at least be able to ask a local about the conditions. At this point the light sprinkle turned into *rain*. As we pushed our tires accumulated mud that eventually clogged in the fork and made pushing at 2mph a grueling task.

We stood there in the rain contemplating what in the *fuck* we should do next. We were in the middle of the woods. We hadn't moved more than twenty miles in almost three hours, I was quickly going through my food and the roads were only getting worse. It was a desperate situation. I'd known what the answer was for almost an hour: return to Danbury and get a room at a motel. Too much time and energy had already been spent to get back to a paved road and come up with a different route. By the time we got back to pavement it would be afternoon. We would still have over one hundred miles to go and it would all have to be done in the rain with no energy, no morale, and no time. We were both a bit reluctant to accept the plan, but when all of our choices were put before us it was the only one that didn't end up with us on an episode of *I shouldn't be Alive*.  
  
We rode a bit and walked a bit on the way back. I disconnected my front brake since it was impossible to move more than 10mph in the quicksand. Much to our satisfaction we saw two vehicles on the return trip. Both were struggling equally in the sand. One spun sideways on a hill, had to back up and take another run at it.

In Danbury we went to the only hotel...the one attached to the casino. I had my heart set on raiding the buffet. They must have seen us coming because we were told there were no rooms available. We backtracked two miles in the rain to a smaller establishment across from a rural bar with more ATVs in the parking lot than cars. They had a room. I was thrilled because the alternative was riding thirty miles to Hinckley. After a shower we walked across the street in cycling shoes and rain gear and ordered about 20,000 calories worth of burgers, appetizers and beer. It was delicious. The most delicious total failure I can remember. After eating we napped for a couple hours, watched the Giants beat the Phillies, and then went back to sleep for another ten hours. It was beautiful.  
  
In the morning we watched television until it was time to check out.

...at which point we walked across the street for more burgers and beer. I watched the rain come down in sheets while contemplating what had happened and waiting for Dave to roll through town with his rescue van. I need some time to reflect on the implications of the epic failure, but for the moment I can appreciate that it was a fun experience. I laughed more on this trip than I have in a long time. There were brilliant moments. Nothing went as planned. I was completely humbled. Much of my equipment completely failed. But it was beautiful, remarkable in its own way, and an experience that I am glad to have had and shared with good people.  
  
Odd moments that I now recall but failed to fit into the story:  
  
A large bird surged unexpectedly through the woods while we were walking. I had a near total freakout and went into a defensive crouch for a solid thirty seconds. Jeff found this hilarious and laughed for an almost equal amount of time. We had the same waitress both in the evening and in the morning at the Fish Bowl. The first thing she said to me was, "Oh! You have a tattoo on your ring finger too!" In the fog of being exhausted I did little more than look at hers and say, *that's very nice*...or something like that. She went on to explain, "...well, it's just that I've never met anyone else with one..." My mind worked slowly and she seemed to take my lack of a response as indication that she should not attempt any more casual conversation (I was trying to think of a polite way to point out that she was in a small town ATV bar). I felt like explaining that I was just braindead from too much exertion. On the return trip Dave's son asked me, "Are you training to be a BEARDMAN??" *Hell yes I'm training to be a BEARDMAN.* I saw more repetitions of "1" than I care to admit (Word count: 1111). This would be an absolutely phenomenal route on a fat bike given another day to make the journey. perhaps more to come...
