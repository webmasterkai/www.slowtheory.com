a few days ago I crossed 1000 miles on my 2010 specialized tricross comp. here are a few thoughts:

- **ride quality:**: without a load or with a light load the bike handles better than almost anything I have ridden. the carbon bits on the front and rear really seem to soften the ride without compromising on fastness. I like that. with a heavy load it handles rather poorly, with a prominent front end shimmy. for most of my riding this is not an issue since I rarely carry anything more than work things. the tires are quite prone to flats, but otherwise are an awesome compromise between performing well on the road and off. the handlebars are phenomenal. they are shallow drop without any stupid "anatomic" flat spots.
- **durability:**: except for a chain wearing out, it's been top notch. the wheels have been an especially pleasant surprise, since on paper they would seem to be a weak point (especially given the way that I have been riding it and the condition of the roads). it is a solid component spec that doesn't really cheap out on anything.
- **gearing:**: they obviously put some thought into the gearing, equipping it with a 34/48 up front and a 12-27 in back. I'd prefer a bit more on the lower end and have screwed around with alternatives, but ultimately the stock gearing is most fitting to the bike. if it was better at carrying a load I might endure getting a triple to shift correctly.
- **versatility:**: this is where the bike really shines. it's cyclocross capable, but also has rack and fender mounts for the 90% of potential buyers who won't be using it for cyclocross.
- **overall:**: so far I've been very pleased. the fit is very good, the bike is lighter than any multi-gear commuter that I've ever had, and I really like its appearance. small touches like using a fork mounted hanger to eliminate fork shudder really complete what is already a really nice bike.
