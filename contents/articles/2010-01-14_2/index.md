I decided that it was spring, so I brought out the fast bike today. the ride to work went surprisingly well. I cut fifteen minutes off of my normal commute time and didn't have to dry my clothing with a fan due to excessive sweating. that was nice. on the way home the results were mixed. I took the long route to the greenway, and that was mostly tolerable. there were a few places where I was skittish on the 32mm tires, but overall the benefits outweighed the temporary uneasiness. I reached the greenway thinking that it would be the easiest portion. I was wrong. the conditions were not good for my bike. the snow was soft, rutted and uninterrupted from the river road to the cedar lake trail. my feet started to get cold from the clipless pedals and I wasn't having very much fun. I learned a valuable lesson: it's not spring yet. tomorrow it's back to the pugsley.
