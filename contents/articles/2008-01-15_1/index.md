It is within its nature  
that it ought to be loved  
Not delicately  
or indelibly  
but violently, recklessly  
in a hopeless tantrum  
that once completed  
is supplanted by taciturnity  
from which despondence  
is thusly negated by  
an impending sense of  
resolve in corpse

Through which begins  
a competition for eternity  
and a skin irritation  
produced by the rubbing  
of loose, coarse fibers

Thereby rescinding  
that residential declaration of  
impenetrable--though  
irreconcilable--coherence  
betwixt two  
obvious alterations of  
one imprecise being  
Tho alternatively  
in scattered, elementally  
divisive  
representations of plausible  
truths
