trashy beggar and self nuanced automatic teller machine  
dream up posthumous antipathy  
of your condescending swallow  
sweet misery's petulant therapy  
while motivated acquaintance murders insistent wife  
resolute in her begrieved garbled plea  
and i write a letter to the president of sony entertainment  
begging  
"helpless shrew seeks original female age eighty-one"  
digging straw bones from my flower garden  
while i wait on bulk postage rate delivered  
helpful clues to dying in turn  
hah!
