Well, here it is. A new website. To ease the boredom induced by the recent stretch of cold weather I decided to program it from scratch. It certainly won't be better, more flexible or feature rich than an application like wordpress, but it consumed some time and further honed my seldom used programming skills. Not everything is completed yet, but the most time consuming tasks are so it's time to start making the transition. I only have a handful of RSS subscribers, but for those people your readers will have to be updated. The address of the new feed is in the sidebar. Old posts have been archived in a massive PDF file that I expect very few people will ever want to download. It's there mostly for my own personal edification--impartial evidence of the compartmentalized absurdity with which I have approached and received my own life. I like to scan through the posts, enliven certain sensations that once lived could never reassert such authenticity. Occasionally a description. I originally began this post trying to describe the opacity of my apartment windows, to capture the sensation of -18F and the hollowness of sound in a seemingly desolate place. The first lines seemed trite so I deleted them and immediately began talking about factual things. "This is what I am doing..."

Anyone who has followed my website for seven years knows that I ripped off the new design from that time. The programming is different. I allow comments now, although I would be surprised if it invites anything other than an unnecessary and unproductive outlet for spam. Nothing special is required to post a comment. And thus ends my reintroduction.
