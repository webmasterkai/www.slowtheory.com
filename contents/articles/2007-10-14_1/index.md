It's the morning of my third day of shingling my parents house. The accumulated aches and pains of running a marathon and spending two long days clutching the loose, gravely surface of a roof have left me slumped over like an old man. There is a strange pain in the lower left part of my back. I look in the mirror and see that my teeth are covered in dirt. I move them back and forth. It is strange, returning to the town where I spent the first nineteen years of my life. I have seen it only a handful of times since I left for college so many years ago. There are now houses behind my parents house. I remember the barren fields that extended endlessly to the edges of the horizon. Now there is a black dog, a shed, garages and a legion of gas grills.
 
There are things weighing heavily on my mind. It unfocuses my eyes and dissolves my thinking mind. I cough. The cycle repeats itself once again--­I and she, once us. Is externality really so important, as to imagine that address is evidence of forethought? For example, I choose to address certain people repeatedly, by name, while others I do not address at all; still others I call by an arbitrary title that somehow describes them. I have mostly quit with this behavior, but in the past I would often say things like, "Hello professor, I have a question about my neurosis, sir." So how ought I to address her? No matter, I'll just start talking. 

My knees and ass are sore. I have worn holes in three fingers of my gloves. I am fatigued. The accumulated mental and physical stress of the past week have left me wrecked, barely able to maintain consciousness past 9pm. 

It is now Saturday morning. I woke up cold. The fifty degree temperature swing in the past week has left me incapable of modulating my body temperature. I wake up cold even though it is the same temperature as a month ago when I woke up warm. 

Some time has passed. I am back in the Twin Cities now, staring out at the effervescent glow of the city. Hidden amongst its many lights and silhouetted structures there are thinking and dying people­--poets intent on degradation, amassed in such a way as to be picturesque, relational only by size and circumstance. I look out from my window. In many ways the sounds of the city are no different from the sounds of the country, except that the air is thinner and I sense at all times that my voice will carry to another human being. I can whisper and be comforted that even without a response I have been heard. I am no longer perpetually cold.
