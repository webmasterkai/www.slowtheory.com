###The breakfast

I woke up at 4am to slather almond butter on the better portion of a loaf of Great Harvest's Dakota Wheat bread. The  subdued, quiet gnawing that ensued was interrupted only by the occasional slurp from an awkwardly shaped coffee mug. 

I am an habitually early riser. This is not because I love morning, but instead because I lack the ability to quickly change pace. I must ease into the day.

###The ride to the start of the race

I met up with the gang at Bryant and the Greenway. I'm always amazed by Justin's ability to orchestrate cool things that no one else could pull off…like people actually showing up for a 6am ride to the suburbs that would ensure riding between 140-175 miles. Sure, other people maybe did it first (in this case, [I rode home from the race in 2010][1]…so maybe I started it!), but no one else has consistently exhibited the ability to attract large and diverse crowds to weird things. There were six of us…or maybe seven? Clearly my mind was not yet at the impressive processing capacity that it achieves later in the day.

The pace was casual. I was still trying to determine whether I would ride with speed or fun as my primary objective. At Almanzo, I opted to try as little as possible, and consequently enjoyed a lovely day of biking and friendship. The allure of repeating that was tempting, but equally alluring was Ken's invitation to try to ride with him at a seven your pace…one which I would described as "medium". Hrmph. I hadn't thought of trying *medium!*

We arrived in Chaska feeling only slightly smug as we passed the parking lot where other racers were extracting bikes from cars, putting on bibs, and shamelessly soliciting the one person who remembered sunscreen.

I was twenty-seven miles into my day.

###The fast part

Ken proposed hitting the early single track section near the front. Fine, fine. "I'll try, but leave me behind if you need to," I replied, flippantly ending my sentence with a preposition.

The race started and the process of the group narrowly avoiding a thirty rider pileup began. We lurched forward only to grind to an immediate halt, punctuated by skidding tires and the wailing of carbon specific brake pads. Ha ha. The silliness. The single track section was not as complicated as last year. Ken was a couple riders in front of me, and we were positioned appropriately.

Then, something started happening. We kept moving up. The paved climb after the singletrack moved us a dozen riders nearer the front. Then another dozen…and so on. As is my habit, I failed to recognize this as a *bad idea*.

The first ten miles of riding too fast went really well. I heroically closed any gap that opened, clipping along in the low to mid twenties without a care in the world. Perhaps the fast riders at the front were trying to discourage the medium riders from hanging on too long, or perhaps I was simply feeling the impact of too much effort, but the yo-yo thing started happening. I continued to close the gaps, but not so enthusiastically. When I was in the group, I no longer felt like I was recovering.

At fifteen miles, I said *enough*, and slowly watched the impressive and chaotic mass of bodies and bikes pull away.

###The slow part

I took a quick inventory. I was a little bit low on water and I hadn't eaten anything. I stopped at a church to try to address the former. The door was locked, and when Ken's group passed by, I quickly hopped on my bike and struggled to latch on. I was once again riding above my comfortable level, and after a few miles decided that I needed more time to recover. I told Ken I was going to drop back. Unexpectedly, he joined me, and we began a short stint of working together.

###The part where I ruthlessly draft behind Justin

It wasn't long before a friendly and familiar voice joined us. Justin had pulled a group of twenty riders up to us, and I happily fell in behind him. Respite. A certain amount of dignity was sacrificed in the next hour, as I clung to his wheel without taking more than a two minute turn at the front. When guilt and obligation finally did overwhelm me, I'd recovered too thoroughly, went too hard, and was absolutely no use to anyone behind me. However, there were a dozen other riders doing the same thing, so my indignity was somehow more tolerable to my keen sense of pride. Or I was just tired.

Around mile thirty-two we stopped for some trail magic with Chris Skogen. He was handing out beer and meat sticks on the side of the road. I spied a can of Coke in his cooler and asked if I could turn in my beer token for a soda. It was fantastic.

###The checkpoint

Riding conservatively, the remainder of the distance to the checkpoint was uneventful, made notable only by running into Kurt S. from my Bicycle Chain days. I still had water, I'd been eating, I'd scored bonus soda from Skogen, and I was pretty much ready to blow through the stop. 

But I didn't. Instead, I joined my group of friends for a short vacation from our bikes. Once again, I'd forgotten that the Dirty Benjamin is an event that allows a drop bag. I loaded up on reddish/brown well water and waited for the group to leave.

###The dramatic lead-up to a flat tire

As we were getting ready to go, I noticed that Justin was gone. I sped off alone to catch him. We would finish almost two hours behind the winners, but the fun race between the Dirty Royal participants still needed to be settled.

Justin's unmistakable shape soon filled the horizon, and it wasn't long before I was back where I belonged, ruthlessly drafting my friend. Of course, karma doesn't let injustice go unpunished, so only moments after catching him, I was greeted with the unmistakable hiss of a flat tire. I cursed. Justin asked if I had everything and went on his merry way.

I set about changing my flat, employing a full array of bike shop honed skills that others might find wholly unimpressive. After a couple minutes, it was seated well enough and inflated to a very rideable 35psi. Off I went.

###The section during which I ride hard to catch the BTRiders

Not long before I finished changing my flat, a group of Bicycle Theory riders--including Ken--passed me. I wasn't sure that I could catch Justin again, but I knew that, barring a navigational snafu, I could catch the BTrain. I rode hard for a few miles down the Luce Line and soon had them within view.

I chatted a bit, but didn't want to hang around too long. I was feeling good and wanted to catch Justin. Shortly after the BRAP section, I found him at the roundabout eating a burrito.

###The part where I stop at the gas station briefly, and then make my move

I told Justin I planned to stop at the BP. He told me that he did not, but that I could probably catch him as he rode by the gas station. I quickly navigated the store, grabbing coffee, refilling my water, and peeing. Hydration was back under control, I'd been eating well, and I knew that I'd be just fine to the finish.

As I left the gas station the BTRiders rolled by. Their ability to work efficiently is super-impressive. They stick together and only take only very short stops. I asked if Justin was still at the roundabout, and to my surprise, he was. Sneaky move, Tim, sneaky move.

After riding with the train for a bit, I decided to go off on my own. I felt good.

###The storm

Very suddenly, the generally benign permaclouds became more menacing and the wind picked up. It soon started to rain. Then it rained harder. I was on the highway going towards the final push on 102nd, which was both a blessing an a cause for anxiety. I couldn't see anyone in either direction and gave serious consideration to finding shelter. I knew that if I could just get to 102nd, I would be fine, so I pushed on.

Eventually I saw a rider in front of me, catching him just before the turn. He had lost his cue cards and was immensely grateful that 1.) I could tell him where to go, and 2.) the remainder of the route was dead simple.

As I started down the final gravel road, the rain eased up.

###The muddy part

The tailwind that I cautiously hoped for had stilled itself. During the worst of the storm, the wind was decidedly in a direction that would have proved advantageous. Alas, after it let up, there was only a mild breeze which was more than offset by soft road conditions.

I just kept pedaling.

###The finish

I caught up with another rider on a Mr. Pink just as we turned on to the paved road. We would ride the rest of the way together. It was still wet enough that drafting was not a desirable option, but it was nice to ride with someone after spending an hour wet, scared, and isolated.

I looked back once or twice and could see a figure on the horizon that I was pretty sure was Justin. I was right. He would finish two or three minutes after me. The epic showdown for Dirty Royal champion was over. I'd won! 

Ken rolled in shortly after that, and Dave a few minutes after that.

###The sun comes out

Doug had quit the race, and one of our other riders didn't expect us to wait for him, so we were just waiting for Jessica. I was getting cold and considering leaving alone. Just then, the sun came out! 

Jessica arrived about an hour later, and we were soon on our way home.

###Stopping at Pizza Luce

Murray met us at Pizza Luce in Hopkins and we enjoyed the post-ride glory due to all Dirty Royal participants. It was a damn good day, and decidedly the most fun I've ever had at the Dirty Benjamin. When I got home, I was at 162.7 miles for the day.
