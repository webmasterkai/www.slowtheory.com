Endless (sic). These were copied from my notebook.

Last night we ate sushi. Sitting around with my friends, absorbing a bit of the glow of their new lives. The beer is different. The roads are bizarre. I'm getting used to it. I wake up a little bit closer to sunrise each day. Only thirty minutes away now. By the time I get home I will be unfixable, waking up later and later and glowing less and less.

Thursday. Exhausted. Last night Matt and I decided that we'd get plane tickets to Kona and spend the day at Volcano National Park. The price was right so we didn't let the 5:52am departure get in the way. My alarm went off at 3am. We are both nervous about being late so it was inevitable that we'd be early, really early. The flight pattern was a rainbow. Up and then down with almost no level flying. On the ground we exited the plane directly on to the tarmac. The airport was like an open air bazaar. The mountains loomed as indistinct outlines in the clouded sky.

On the ground it is weird. Lava has dictated what things can grow and where they can grow. Luscious green landscapes disappear and reopen as if by magic, separated by barren seas of black volcanic rock. 4000 foot. It is strange how cold it is here. I am wearing almost everything that I brought with to this island, and it is almost not enough. The sky is permanently misting, even against the backdrop of clear blue skies.

Morning near the volcano. The irony is that I am freezing. I met someone interesting last night. Sunset. Moonrise. The full outline of the quarter moon was plainly visible. The stars kept appearing. One after another. Near the moon a blinding light. A beacon to stargazers, poets and dreams. I met someone interesting. Myst. Perpetual wanderer and berry eater. Tragically energetic amidst a sea of complacency. Anachronism? No. What is the word for something in its proper time but an improper place? I don't remember how things started. Mumble mumble. Matt said something to her. Then she asked where we were going. We were going to the same place. The night volcano. Assiduous lavagazer and star speculator. I'd never seen the sky with so many stars and to have pure freedom and bliss beneath it felt incredible. I felt myself changing. Even half braindead from lack of sleep I understood the impact that I faced. Pisces and virgo. How many times have I stumbled down that path only to lose myself to a vast nothingness? Incomprehension? Near-madness? Vigour. And on and on. On the ledge together, gazing at the stars and spitting words as if at any moment the stars might crash into us. Wandering, foraging, bicycles, death, pain, meaning, astrology. I was exhilarated to meet someone so forthright, so open to having a meaningful conversation with a stranger. Free thought. Free will. Free expression. I wonder sometimes what the stranger walking up the side of the road thinks about. I almost never find out. I wonder about the shapes that we share. Our human shapes. Our passions and compassion. But I almost never find out. She wanted to find out more about her parents and she needed a virgo. Industrious, hard working virgo and his glowing case of discipline. Self control. She will continue to travel. Her parents will continue to misunderstand her, and everything else will be the same. Except me. Somehow I have changed.
