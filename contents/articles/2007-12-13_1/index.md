I took my first longer trip on the Pugsley today. Inspired by fellow interspace blog posters I decided to take a journey without any particular purpose except to ride through some snow. I rode toward fort snelling with the vague notion of checking the condition of the nearby trails. Unfortunately by the time I reached the area the temperatures were in the thirties and the snow was wet, heavy and nearly unrideable. I quickly abandoned the notion of an extended offroad ride and started heading back via the trail along the river that runs from Mendota to Saint Paul. Somewhat surprisingly the paved trail was in worse condition than any of the offroad trails that I surveyed. It hadn't been plowed since the first snowfall. Not to be deterred, I proceeded to ride as well as I could, alternating between rutted foot prints and the deeper, heavier snow along the edges, taking many breaks to simply push my way through the dense snow. By the time I reached the road again I had let so much air out of my tires that I had to stop to refill them with my handpump. I turned back to the west, into wind gusts of 40mph with sustained 20mph+. It was a slow crawl home.
