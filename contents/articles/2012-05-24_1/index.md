It was the early part of 2009, a few months after Alex had returned from his framebuilding class at UBI. Despite having already made two frames, I still didn't consider him a "framebuilder". He was just a friend who happened to have built a couple of frames. When the idea emerged of building a frame for me, my response was something like this--"Yeah...sure...you can build me a frame...just make me a singlespeed to replace my Raleigh and I'll ride it to the bar." I didn't really take it seriously. I figured I'd ride it around a little bit, give him some feedback, and maybe help him develop his skill.  
  
In March, it was ready. I swapped over some parts from the Raleigh, and threw in some new bits. It looked like this:

During the first couple weeks I was surprised by how nicely the bike rode. I hadn't given much input on the geometry, tubing, or desired ride qualities, but I nonetheless felt completely at home during my commute. It wasn't long before I wanted the bike to do things that I'd rather not do on a singlespeed. I hadn't had the foresight to make it compatible with external gears, so I put a nexus hub on it.

It quickly became a bike that did a lot of things:

Eventually I got sick of the \*ahem\* oddness of the Nexus hub and went back to singlespeed. It was sad to concede that it would be undesirable for certain adventures, but the mushiness and unpredictability of the internal gear hub needed to go.

It remained a popular bike in my collection. I rode it almost exclusively for commuting, and even did a couple of centuries on it, one on the gravel. However, I always had it in the back of my mind that someday it needed to revised with a derailleur hanger, additional tire clearance, and maybe a few other goodies.

In early 2012, with over 10,000 miles on the frame and Alex's queue quickly filling, I decided that it was time to act. Alex originally did a magnificent job extracting geometry and tubing choices both from my vague comments and his knowledge of my riding habits, but it was time to fix the few things that I didn't properly consider initially.  
  
I made my list:  
  
**A new fork**: When he originally built the frame, he didn't have a fork jig, so we put a Surly pacer fork on there. It was ugly and lacked ample clearance for proper gravel tires. The goal was  a much more elegant fork, with canti bosses, a flat crown, and mid-fork eyelets.

**S&S couplers**: This one was a little bit gratuitous, but if you're already paying for paint, why not?! From the moment I decided on this modification, my mind quickly began inventing interesting scenarios where a more portable bike would be a huge asset.

**New dropouts**: I opted for very plain, hanger equipped vertical dropouts. Singlespeed was too limiting for my purposes.
Modified cable stops: Added accommodations for a front derailleur and moved some things around.

**Canti bosses on the rear**: I had been using long reach caliper brakes, because that's what was on the donor bike for the original project. The Paul cantilevers offer enormously better performance, tire clearance, aesthetic appeal.

**New paint/powdercoat**: After years of riding the mysterious, unlabeled red frame, I decided that it was time to get proper paint/powdercoat.
I think it turned out beautifully.
