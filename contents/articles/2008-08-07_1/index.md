![Specialized S-works](http://f.slowtheory.com/3276766122_64a074deb1_o.jpg "Specialized S-works")

Since selling my Independent Fabrication a couple months ago I've been without a road bike. I used about half of the money to buy a new mountain bike. I've been generally delighted having a mountain bike, but the need for a fast road bike still existed. Enter, the ZEB-RAW. Specialized still had some 2003 aluminum Sworks frame available at a nice price, so I decided to order a frame and piece together a bike. The goal was to keep the combined cost of the new road and mountain bikes around the amount that I got for the IF (swapping pre-owned parts with coworkers and/or using parts from the parts bin was considered free). I very nearly succeeded. I ended up with a mostly SRAM Rival bike and Hed Ardennes wheels. Total weight: 16.46 pounds.

My goal in trying SRAM was simply to try it. Beyond being naturally curious, I figured it was good experience to have in my bike shop arsenal. I didn't except to like it very much. Adjusting bikes in the stand left me with the sensation that I'd spontaneously developed a repetitive stress injury. However, my initial impression was very positive. The hood shape is phenomenal, much better than either campy or shimano. The rear shifting was as quick and precise as you'd expect from any high end group. The front shifting sucks. Dropping down to the little chainring is easy enough, but getting back up to the large is ridiculous. It's a one shot sort of deal, any attempt to further coax the chain up on to the large ring will be met with a seemingly random drop back to the little chainring. Likewise, trying to trim the front derailleur in the large ring (I'm not even sure if this is in the design) is impossible. It simply drops to the little ring. Basically, 98% of the things that you do with the front shifter will result in the chain being on the small ring. While this sounds terrible, it doesn't bother me very much. I roll with compact cranksets and large cassettes, so the majority of my time is spent in the large ring. I only shifted to the little ring once on today's ride, and it was a mistake as I went up the hill in 34-13 sounding like Lou Reed. 

The bike is amazingly quick. It's nothing magical about the blend of aluminum or the few carbon bits. It's just very light weight, especially in the wheels where it matters the most. I had some difficulty with the front wheel flexing the spoke magnet into the spoke sensor, but aside from that everything went very well. The fit is perfect for what the bike is designed to do. I had to spacer jack the fork to get the drop to less than three inches, but that was to be expected given my long inseam, short arms, and the fact that I bought a straight up race frame.
