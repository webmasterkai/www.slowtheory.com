lately I have been treating my hands poorly and having strange dreams. a particular friend and I casually made eye contact without any spark of recognition on his behalf. eyes gleaming, I grabbed him and begged him to understand the relevance of our unlikely intersection. *understand me*, I muttered, saliva projecting itself into the fabricated air of my imagination. hah. ha. nothing moved as it should have. perhaps I knew that I was dreaming. earlier in the yesterday I calculated this paradox: I announced to my dream companion that we were in a dream and it could be anything, but it was not at all anything. it remained just as it would have been and I did not awake (as I often would at the peculiar moment during which I realized my physically removed anti-presence). so I admitted upon waking that it was strange that the usual ripples of unearthing a dream seemed not to manifest and everything played out as it might have if I had not said anything. I speculated, of course, *oh shit I have no relevance anymore!* however, later it was brought to my attention that I'd fallen asleep while watching alice in wonderland and had merely carried with me the last of it with the last of me. so there I was, standing with him in this unusual restaurant with its military/industrial/jockbar vibe, shaking him by the shoulders and trying fruitlessly to make him care that we hadn't seen each other in a decade. begrudgingly he resigned himself to my presence. I was not affected by his disinterest. no no. I was thrilled. I introduced him to the new things in my life and paid no attention to the growing undercurrents of distaste emanating from his unflinching, but distant expression. (at present, my downstairs neighbors are listening to bad TV and YELLING).  
  
they are downstairs yelling at each other.  
  
I've been mildly productive in between dreaming lately. I've been running again. I already have completed an eight and a half mile training run for a half marathon that does not happen for another three weeks. that's *solid*. during my run the other day I actually felt *fast*. this is unusual. I am not a gifted runner. my femur is either too long or too short, my upper body is ill suited, my feet are misshapen and my coordination is poor....or, uhm, I just don't run enough. I'm not sure, but I do know that I felt fast while running a few days ago and it was utterly amazing. I ran near the mississippi river on an unplowed trail. it was serene. the slight snow cover was not only aesthetically charming, but forced the more intelligent or casual people to the plowed path a hundred feet up in the air. I was alone next to the river, with water turning to ice, the sun turning to a dazzling display of artificially colored rainbow sherbet, and small animals intriguing me with their *bustling*.  
  
other random prideful moments:  
  
hanging plastic window insulation all by myself learning the *backstitch* hand sewing technique finally buying a disc surface facing tool for the shop redesigning my lake shoe covers and fixing my fraying left boot making a delicious dinner of garbanzo beans, rice and carrots finally ordered the right ram  
  
enough bragging. I fuck up sometimes too.  
  
dropped a glass saucepan and sliced my index finger open grabbed a bowl out of the toaster oven and burned my thumb forgot to tighten my rear wheel and had it embarrassingly fall off while leaving the shop with dave tried to modify a mukluk liner and ruined it forgot to leave a package for a friend in a secret location even after being reminded to do so five minutes before it needed to be done didn't bring michelle pizza thirty seconds after she asked me to bring her pizza walked into the display of sunglasses for the 202nd time in 2011 told dave to order the wrong ram three different times for the office computer  
  
okay, well, that's my life right now. I need to start writing more. I miss it.
