The weekend was *work on the house *weekend. I did manage to get in a 6+ mile run yesterday, and a bit of cycling today, but it was mostly about hunkering down and taking on some of the tasks that have been lingering for six weeks now.  
  
I tore down some of the sketchy shelving downstairs and went shopping at Menards for a more useful replacement.

Carry-out man was a bit perplexed when I said, "Oh, I'm over here." I anticipated that the bike helmet would be enough of a cue.  
  
While I was in the basement knocking things down, Michelle was in the yard picking things up. Leaves, to be precise.
