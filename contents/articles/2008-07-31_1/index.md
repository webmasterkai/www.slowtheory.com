There's a spot near garden street and snelling where I've seen at least a car crash per week since they started construction on snelling a month and a half ago. Today the road was pretty much blocked and they were loading someone into an ambulance. The problem seems to be that at the spot where northbound traffic changes from two lanes to one, people keep running into each other. It's difficult for me to understand as the lane blockage is clearly marked and traffic is usually moving at very low speeds. I needed to run to the grocery store so I ended up taking fairview home. Traffic was backed up from Roselawn to Larpenteur, a stretch of 0.5 miles, as people diverted from snelling. What an unpleasant way to get around! At the grocery store a woman started talking to me about the big dummy. It turns out that I sold her husband an xtracycle a couple months back. I like talking to other long bike people.

When I woke up this morning I could barely move my head. I inspected the base of my neck where a now familiar pain has settled inÂ­to, nothing unusual. I went about my morning routine trying to pretend as though nothing was different. I don't recall if I had a bowl of cereal, but I know that I did not make coffee or pack a lunch. I brushed my teeth but I have no idea what my reflection looked like in the mirror. I may or may not have used hand soap, and it could have been any one of three varieties. The pain at the base of my neck began somewhere between 6:30am and 6:45am. I woke up, decided I needed a few more minutes sleep, and then woke up again in unusual discomfort. I recall vividly the last two times that I've had the same sort of pain in the same area. The second to last was less than a year ago, two days before the marathon in Milwaukee. I remember running in place in the hotel room, trying to convince myself that turning my head was not a requirement for distance running. Fortunately, the pain subsided and I was able to run without difficulty. It has now been sixteen hours since I felt that first twinge of discomfort, and I have no reason to believe that it won't continue for another sixteen, and perhaps another after that. It is an oddity, a reminder of the cruelty of the mundane. To suffer in agony for the difficult and the tragic is beautiful. To wake up with a crippling pain for no reason is gut wrenching. Frail, pitiful thing! The pain will eventually go away and I will forget temporarily what type of creature I am. I will inflate my self analysis becoming a strength that fluctuates just as one's interest in a conversation, something piqued and redirected by its own will. I am flabbergasted and angry, unwilling to accept these terms.

It is morning again. It seems much earlier than it is. The lower skyline shows the pink contamination of predawn, yet the sun has been up for three hours.

It is afternoon. I have accomplished little today. The early morning rain has turned into a humid, sticky afternoon. I took a nap. I read some. I went to the grocery store. I picked bones out of a large chunk of fish. It was odd because I could almost see structure in it, almost imagine how everything worked before it was sliced apart for my happiness. There will be no mountain biking or weight lifting today. It is, therefore, an irregular thursday that's already quickly slipping away.

It is evening. I went out for a ride on the big dummy to watch people ride home on the greenway. I admit a certain partiality to beautiful women on either very slow or very fast bikes. The ones in the middle receive no particular notice, except that which I have for a fellow human being on a bicycle. This includes ten speeds with steel rims, and anything with 38mm tires and/or barends. The frequency of bicycles equipped with very sensible panniers made me smile. This is the riding-home-from- work-crowd. This is the summer-is-a-time-for-self-analysis crowd. This is madness and beauty.

Interesting thing about me: when I read it is almost always 20-25 pages at a time.
