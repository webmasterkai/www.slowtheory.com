It is the middle of the night. I woke up to the post-bar-close-yelling of the drunken imbeciles who live in my apartment building. They stand beneath my window yelling, "I tell you wu-hat. I tell you hoo-ooh." It's an hour and a half later now and I can't get back to sleep. I wonder what their inner monologue sounds likeÂ­does it have the same discordant boisterousness, this over-exuberance of dimwittedness? Do they think loud, annoying thoughts that are nothing more than vomited sound bites? Perhaps it is just the opposite, and they are thinking with clarity and complexity that would utterly defeat my most attuned senses. I think of other people and places. How irrational it all seems. And is it my imagination, or is the word "fond" always used with the greatest degree of spite and enmity? I will remember us fondly. I have written-almost-sent, or thought-almost-written, or almost-conceived-scarcely-rejected certain principals of affection that, had I not suffered an immediate cessation of cognitive ability, might have escaped these hard fought moments of the night and completely transformed the particulars of my life. Oh, my head. C ulturally I remain tangential. It rained hard for ten minutes. It is the time of year when everything in my bedroom feels damp. C ondensation forms on my bed sheets before night time and I tuck myself in. It is uncomfortable and the odors are unpleasant. Still, it is nice to change the terms of my relationship with the outside world.
