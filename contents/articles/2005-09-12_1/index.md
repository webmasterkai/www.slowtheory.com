yesterday: 'had a good ride this morning, but it seems i can't go an entire day without getting honked at by a fat woman in a minivan or suv. this time it was a minivan. i really wouldn't complain if an urban robin hood started vandalizing automobiles. you know...just a thought. for the moment i try to content myself with the implicit knowledge that she struggles while walking up stairs and has probably, at some time or another, faced ridicule for her sloth. i think i would have a better impression of motorists if an equal number would slow down and yell something like, "i'm impressed by your (speed ...aerodynamic position on the bicycle...smooth cadence...aesthetic presence...physical fitness...leg strength...nice ass)," or even if someone would occasionally give a friendly wave that said something other than, "i'm going to wave you on because you're clearly an idiot and might bike into the side of my auto-tank if i start moving." '

today: 6:25am. woke up early and now i'm regretting it as the groggy inexplicably sets in (though i found it almost impossible to fall asleep and tossed and turned restlessly all night while dreaming of the penal colony). i might go back to sleep for another half hour or so and see what strange dreams come while i wait for the sun to come up to go for a quick bike ride before work. sometimes it's hard to convince myself to go out riding, not because i do not like riding, but because of my proximity to nothing of interest. it's a gauntlet for me to get anywhere interesting. there is a buffer around me that sometimes feels like land waylaid by nuclear holocaust, like i'm spinning my bike through chernobyl. i ran across a website once about a woman who drove her motorcycle through chernobyl. she was the daughter of a scientist and had all of the tools and equipment to keep track of the radiation and ensure that she remained within non lethal levels. there were some pretty convincing photographs that have turned me into a believer. i cut my hair last night. i look like a russian racquetball player.

later: 9:00am. slept again until 8:30. decided to post things on ebay instead of go for a morning ride. will go out after work.

later still: 9:00pm. twelve hours later. my sponge in my kitchen sink smells awful. coffee grounds were mysteriously piled on it and i would have never dreamt such an odor could derive from such a different one. i buy certain kinds of cereal because they are the only ones that will fit on the shelves in my cabinets. grapenuts, mostly. i'm cleaning my apartment. i'm getting things done. i'm calculating how to get more down. i really have things together. i'll make a deposit in the bank. i'll make a withdrawal (not from the bank). i'll clean. i'll flip a coin.

school has only just started and already i can't help feeling constantly tired. it's a premature kind of tired, one that knows more of what's coming than what is and has been. it knows that soon the daylight will because a phantom and most often i'll find myself under the eternal glow of every other streetlamp. it knows what's coming. it knows that i will fall behind and call on my graceless ability to stumble many paces without quite falling. sometimes i can make it just far enough to stumble across the finish line. oftentimes not.

now more cleaning.

i always start in the kitchen.

9:36pm: now i'm done.
