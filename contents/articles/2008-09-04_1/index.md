August was a good month overall, but not necessarily for cycling. I cleaned up my diet and started building a solid foundation to beat some of my personal bests in 2009. However, to facilitate good eating habits and reduced caloric intake, I upped the intensity of my rides while cutting the distance, resulting in: 

- August Cycling: 476.7 miles 
- Cycling 2008: 3608.27 miles (+510.32 miles from 2007) 

My approach to running was much the same: shorter, more intense runs. I'm trying to acclimate my body to running faster. I'm very comfortable running nine minute miles, but running sub nine or even sub eight minute miles is difficult. I mapped out a two mile course that I've been using both as speed training and to assess the relationship between body weight and running speed. I've timed myself on the course three times. Here are the results: 8/03 17:26 8/26 16:39 9/04 15:41 In one month I've managed to take 1:45 off of my total time and push my pace below eight minute miles. That's good. I still have to be vigilant in my eating and my training if I want to be able to sustain faster speeds over the course of a marathon, but I'm headed in the right direction. 

## vermin supreme for president?: part I 

Last night I went to downtown Saint Paul with some people from the bike shop to check out the RNC chaos. Aside from haunting images of a police state, the most alarming of which was a policeman directing us and the car next to us to run over some pedestrians who were in the crosswalk so that a brigade of horse-police could roll on through, there was little going on. For every police-person there was perhaps 0.8 to 0.9 regular people, meaning that if everyone in the area suddenly turned unlawful the largest, strongest and most violent 10% of the crowd would have two lawmen available to detain them, while everyone else would have one. Thorough! Matt, Alex and Nathalie turned home early while Dave and I stuck around to see if we could get closer to the evil center. We gave up quickly and decided to have a beer. Behind us there was a person dressed in a crazy-suit being interviewed for at least fifteen minutes. It seemed to symbolize the whole spectacle. I wonder how much of it was going to make it on to television. Ten seconds? As we were leaving a shaggy looking gentleman was crossing the street with a sign that read "Vermin Supreme 08 or something like that. He started talking to us. "Yeah, that's me, I'm runnnning for presssident. Here, I'll give you a sticker." He handed me a sticker. I like stickers so I stuck it in my freeloader. When I got home I went online to figure out what he was all about. Here's a good link. C heck it out! He sounds like my kind of guy.
