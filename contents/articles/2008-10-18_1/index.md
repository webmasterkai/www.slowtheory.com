It was a beautiful morning, and nothing seemed more pleasant than the thought of loading up my bicycle with camping gear and heading out for a couple of days. The plan was to ride south towards the state park about ten miles southeast of Red Wing. Most of my bicycle trips this year have been north, so I chose the destination simply as a change of pace. I was undecided until just hours before the trip on which of my bicycles to take. I ended up going with an untested setup: my Waterford road bike with the BOB trailer. Within a few miles I could tell that I'd made a poor choice. The thin tubing and light front end transferred足--perhaps accentuated--足the trailer shimmy into the steering. I thought a few times about turning back, but I was committed. It was already a late start after I slept in, and switching bikes would only make it worse. I figured that I'd just get used to it. 

I loaded up my GPS and found that it had loaded the incorrect route. Strange, since I had printed and loaded the route at the same time. I was now relying on a few sheets of paper for navigation. This turned out to not be as large of an issue as I expected, but it put me in a sour mood for a while. Once out of the Saint Paul area things started to improve. I made some very good road selections and encountered almost no traffic. Outside of the city my bike selection also started to pay off. With the slight tailwind, I could cruise easily between 17-21mph. I was making great time.

Once I descended into Hastings my road selection got a lot worse. Out of Hastings I took a small road called Ravenna Trail that appeared so small on the map I wasn't even sure that it would be paved. Unfortunately it was paved, but completely without a shoulder, and traffic was heavy. I have to give my kudos to the drivers, however, as not one passed close enough to make me nervous. In fact, this was true of the entire trip with the exception of a lone corvette that buzzed by me at at least 90mph (in a 50). I soon got off of that road an on to a much better road. It had a great shoulder and not much traffic. This is where I continued my flat streak. Since it was a beautiful day and I was making great time, I opted to patch the tube on the side of the road. It was still fairly early in the trip, and the more supplies that I could conserve, the better. 

Once rolling again I encountered a monstrous, winding climb to Highway 61. C limbing up it was especially horrible, but coming down was, in fact, the more frightening of the two experiences. The descent led directly to the highway and my caliper brakes, super flexy wheels, and shimmying trailer made it a harrowing experience.

I followed 61 for a few miles to the Cannon Valley trail. To my surprise there was no access point. Not to be deterred, I separated bike and trailer and climbed down the steep embankment. The trail reminded me of the gateway--足lots of unobservant walkers acting unpredictably. At the end of the trail I found out why there wasn't a highway 61 access point--足it was a pay to play trail, obviously designed to be a bikes-r-toys trail that shirked connection points to places where bikes clearly don't belong. I found it mildly irritating, but paid the fee anyway. Make no mistake, I like my money being used for bicycle trails, I just think they should be made convenient for travel and transportation. 

I followed 61 the rest of the way to the park. I saw another cyclist a few miles from the park. It was exciting and I offered a hearty wave. I stopped at the park office. The woman asked me to walk my bike on the trails, and told me that she was writing "two" for the number of occupants so that "people wouldn't wonder..." I didn't realize solo camping trips were so highly suspicious. Just after the park office there was a sustained 10% climb that went on for almost a mile. It was really quite an awful way to end my ride. 

I set up camp, made dinner, and explored some of the "hiking trails", many of which were paved. Seriously? A paved "hiking trail"? There was no shortage of downed trees, so towards sunset I gathered wood for a fire. The temperature was rapidly dropping. For about three hours I split my time between gathering firewood and reading by the fire. It had its charm, but I decided that when there are twelve or more hours of darkness, I prefer camping with other people. The moon was an amazing shade of orange. It was autumn.

I slept pretty well, waking up only a few times as my sore body made its complaints known. I checked the temperature on my bike computer and found that it had plunged into the thirties. My sleeping bag was nice and toasty and I struggled to extract myself from it in the morning. The morning was dreary. It couldn't have been more different than the previous day. I walked the last few bits of trail and decided that I would leave a day early. There wasn't much else for me to do at the park, and the thought of spending a rainy day inside of my tent without a book to read (I'd finished it the previous night) was unappealing. I packed up my things just as it started to rain. 

I started off well. My legs were feeling better than I expected and the headwind wasn't as bad as I expected it would be. Things went well until Red Wing. I decided not to fuck around with the trail again, and instead stayed on 61. Out of Red Wing 61 climbs steadily for about three miles. It's only 2-3 percent, but by the top of the climb my back was aching. The combination of lots of seated climbing in gears that were too big and constantly stabilizing the shimmying bike had fatigued my lower back to the point where it was difficult to ride even on the hoods. Once I'd reached the top of the climb the wind seemed to pick up. I just kept riding, telling myself that these things ebb and flow. It was a bad moment and nothing more. I stopped in Miesville to eat a granola bar. On a whim I decided to top of my rear tire with a co2 inflator. In order to conserve my supplies I opted to use a handpump the previous day. It was probably only at about 80psi. Once I was back on the road I could tell that it made a difference. I was faster and everything seemed to be bobbing around less. Highway 61 just south of Hastings was actually quite a pleasant ride. The shoulder was enormous and it had those irritating ruts as an added barrier between me and the car traffic. I opted to stay clear of Ravenna trail. It was a smart move. 

Once I'd gotten through Hastings I stopped at a gas station for Red Bull, Potato chips, and a Snickers bar. The last stretch would be easy. The worst thing about riding home was that it seemed like a series of long, grinding uphills followed by extremely steep downhills. This combination completely negated the advantage of the downhill as I had to ride the brakes so that the BOB wouldn't shimmy out of control. Nonetheless, the time passed quickly and I was soon home. This was my third camping setup of the year and by far the worst. Even though I was able to ride quite easily at speeds that the other two setups couldn't touch, it was hideously unwieldy and uncomfortable. Overall it was still a very enjoyable trip and I'm glad that I tried the combination.
