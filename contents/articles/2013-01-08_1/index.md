When I was a teenager, I was obsessed with computers. I installed every distribution of Linux before ending up with NetBSD (*sans X windows*). I learned vi, customized my .kshrc endlessly, idled on IRC hoping someone would version request me, mastered perl regular expressions, and audited the permissions for every file on my computer (hah ha! This, in spite of the fact that I was on a single-user system behind a router). Data and organization. Logic structures. Stuff.

I would eventually fall out of love with it. In a dramatic gesture, I stopped pursuing a degree in computer science and foreswore technology (except when it was really awesome and convenient, like Facebook and email).

This would last for a while. Eventually I was lured back in for purely practical reasons--the bike shop needed better infrastructure to manage repairs, bike inventory, pricing information, and special orders. None of the solutions available were the appropriate to our needs at the time, so I made something. For several years, we used my system. It worked well. I was able to add features quickly because the codebase was both familiar and minimal. 

I mostly stayed away from computers beyond this. I kept a website, but it was content driven. I'd have the most delightful monologue with myself, and contribute it to the buzz of cyberspace. Nothing more. Rather than endless data accumulation and interpretation, I wanted to collect and sort my life.

Three months ago I was lured back in by the promise of more money, skill diversification, and the opportunity to build something unique, interesting, and challenging, while working with creative, passionate, and motivated people. I had to do it. The first couple months were a challenge. Adapting to Drupal and its implementation and deployment was awkward. So many things were automated, and often, outright mysterious. "Oh, links broken? Migrate the site to a different sub-domain, then migrate it back. Aegir will fix it." That's weird. Exciting, at first, until it didn't work. The structure was so bloated and complex that there was a dependency on *mysteriousness* to resolve many straightforward issues. For someone whose experience was primarily with the command line, it felt awkward. I didn't know where to look when things broke.

I sort of learned though. At least I learned enough to fix things, do some basic module programming, and implement features through point-and-click, drag-and-drop. It still didn't feel like *me*. 

In the past week there has been a new direction--static sites. It is the fixed gear bicycle of the computing world. Stripped to its essential components, a static site--dynamically generated--offers the most beautiful, comprehensible, and flexible website infrastructure imaginable.

Soâ€¦all of this is to say, this is my new website. It is a static site, generated using ruhoh and markdown files that I extracted from my previous drupal site. It feels more like me. There's a lot that needs to be done yet, but I'm excited about the direction that it's heading. Suddenly, web development doesn't feel so weird and unnatural. More soon.
