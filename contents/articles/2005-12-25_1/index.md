i wake up around 11am. it's chilly in my apartment so i close my window. the weather has been unseasonably warm for a minnesota december, and in stark contrast to the weeks prior. my apartment is a mess. yesterday i worked an extra six hours because what else is there to do? i could have come home to my messy apartment. i found something better--working a fourteen hour shift on new year's eve.

it's been a monumental day so many times that just this once i need it to be nothing. i need a two day dull imagination and limitless silence.
