I have keys that don't go anywhere. I study their shape with my hands, then my eyes, trying to remember what they once opened. They're in a box of pictures--half a face, my old stupefied manner of walking through doors looking perpetually amused but disinterested, somehow pre-adulthood, grinning in a swell of self-improvement. Years have passed since then and I wonder why I keep these things, why it is that reaching under my bed yields nothing of purpose. I have six red markers, six everlasting FUC K-YOUs. Like every other dope who has ever lived, I've collected things in an attempt to imprint certainty and solidity in something that is forever returning to its native nothingness. A printer cable but no printer--the AMERIC AN DREAM. Surrounding and encasing myself in walls of artifacts, occasionally (perhaps only rarely) brushing them off and trying to solve the mystery of the thing watching being watched. From left to right I could identify only half of the people by name, dripping in bravado and testosterone, although not a woman in sight. It's like a barge carrying a single passenger bound for a business meeting in hell. I find myself increasingly infatuated with the chinese girl who lives next door. It is not because she is beautiful or because I am lonely, but because her expression makes me think that she is finding out everything horrible about life all at once. It seems just that serious, just that free of bullshit, just that immune to posturing. What should I do with an old wedding ring? Put it on my finger and hope that I turn invisible and become gradually possessed by the evil eye of sauron? It didn't fit. 

Autumn has officially started. The morning air is crisp and I've felt myself become less and less inclined to do anything useful with my time. Normally it is during this transition that my mind is active, but it has not been the case. I have scarcely written a word and I read only a few pages at a time, often not retaining even the names of the characters on the pages. It is embarrassing. I am ashamed of the insignificance of my mind and the unimportance of my ideas. Like others, I spend most of my time relating my experiences in purely unimaginative terms. "This is what I did today..." But it does not matter. Conversation is almost always about winning and losing, balancing astuteness with scarcity of language and the precision of scripted drama. Ideal y one never becomes fully invested or completely removed. It's like volleying in tennis. The greatest pleasure is to win, while the greatest embarrassment is to strike the ball wide or into the net. The things in between comprise the rest of dignified existence. 

At the beginning of 2008 I made a resolution to not buy any new bikes. I did great until April when the big dummy became available. I hadn't originally planned to get one, but a combination of them being difficult to acquire and romantic visions of summer camping tours made it inescapable. At that point I behaved similarly to an alcoholic, indulging my every whim for the next six months. I find myself nearing the end of September once again happy with my selection of bicycles, while simultaneously amused at how similar each is to its spring equivalent. I have decided to reclaim the resolution that failed me so easily in hopes that, like my first attempt at running a marathon, failure will provide the motivation that I need to succeed. In selecting my five bicycles I have decided to associate each with a race that I may never do, but that would be well suited to the bicycle. 

1. Waterford road bike - RAAM 
2. Surly Pugsley - Arrowhead 135 
3. Surly Big Dummy - Great Divide Race 
4. Surly Karate Monkey - TransIowa 
5. Raleigh Supercourse SS - New Belgium Urban Assault (done!) 

It is perfect.
