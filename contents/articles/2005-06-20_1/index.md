I'm getting the fuck out of the city this weekend. I'm leaving Friday evening after work, turning my phone off, smashing my computer, and if I don't come back I swear that I didn't mean it. I'm delirious with excitement. This is what I need. The word “fuck” coils up again, this time in the tender arms of “yeah”.
