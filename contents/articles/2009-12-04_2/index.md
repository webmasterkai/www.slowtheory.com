today was the first cold day since spring. after doing very little all day I went out for a ride on the pugsley in the evening. I am signed up for the north shore ultra race in january, so I have to take advantage of the next month to get my gear figured out. dogwood poagies performed wonderfully. I wore lightweight full finger cycling gloves and didn't get cold at any point. I probably could have been bare handed and done fine. wind did not penetrate like it would have with thicker gloves and moisture did not accumulate. thumbs up. lake boots were a fail. I ordered some keen non-cycling boots that I plan to use with platform pedals. I'll probably start using those tomorrow. my feet got quite cold with the lake boots. I have hotronic warmers on my shimano shoes, but they don't work well for hike-a-bike or long periods at low temperatures. the keen boots are rated to -25F and are a bit big, so I can fit extra socks. if I can keep my hands and feet warm I'm confident about the rest.
