love hate situate in death two parts alleviate

wicked rumination, playful masturbation, and theoretical love

i’m waiting in the basement of the science building for my evening class to start. i wrote this in my earlier class:

i’m in the classroom of worn out language. she chats with the map of north america, digging out her own words from the wall behind me. i’m vacant and she’s intent on filling me with her so she can look right back at herself and think, "ah, there i am." click clack. one hour. two hours. another half. three hours. winter makes me bitter. this is where i choose to be, somedays, and this is what i choose to be--her self reflexive chalkboard to eat up the bullshit

and leak it--ambient--in these little dark halls where hoodlums in hoodies rape each other with ballpoint pens. i’m digging to find out that there is nothing there. the profit margin of an early death is best displayed with a pie graph. it’s snowing again and where do i want to be and, once there, what do i want to be doing? elle looked frazzled today, ready to write that thing i want to read. i’d watch her wait by the toaster to the hum of electric soul and the vague smell of burnt toast. i’m interested in the transcendental quality of packaging. i’m interested in the dark sexual desires of men and chimps. ...different...special little flower that i grow, pamper, and defend against an earth intent on an ill climate...problematic disease...suffer in silence. populate in numbers. kill the inconvenient and apologize the unfortunate. the dreadful drip drip and panties on the lampshade. elle couldn’t imagine my countenance in all of this. she could only say, "boo. i scared you."

the other. won’t go away. won’t stay buried. in. take me with you. i’m dying for dirt, one shovel full at a time until i’m nothing but a last gasp. i lose myself in there. i bleed despair. i look away and what but more wrath. he’s gotten a hold of me. he’s gotten my attention. i am the gift of what i give and there’s no more.

i’m interested in dark desires and why i feel this way.

i’m interested in pop culture and sixty percent beef hamburger.

what i need to know is why and when.

countdown to meltdown tee minus twenty-two minutes

hell abounds on crinkled lips, deforming at angles until ceaseless villainy and dope god malice. haunt haunt. chant chant.
