Aw. The Almanzo. Most years I go into the race feeling much too serious about everything. I obsess over nutrition strategy, bemoan the difficulty of navigating the sketchy first miles, and optimistically project my fortunes well beyond my reasonable capacity to do so. This has led to a string of self-induced misfortunes and increasingly bad races. This year, I was determined to reshape my experience in a way that re-prioritized the things that I deem important: friendship, camaraderie, and a beautiful day spent soaking in the scenery, while reveling in the simple joy of riding my bicycle.

After struggling to make transportation arrangements, I finally connected with Ugur and settled on a Saturday morning departure. We parked at the high school, grabbed our numbers, and lined up at the start. After and emotional pre-ride address from organizer Chris Skogen, we were on our way.

I wanted to stay with Ugur, both because it would fulfill the friendship element of my stated ride purpose, and because it would make for easier post-ride logistics. Of course, that's never how it happens. The only ride during which I recall spending the duration with another rider was last year's Dirty Lemming. It just doesn't work that way.

We mostly stuck together for the first ten miles. I would ride uphill a bit faster, while Ugur would descend faster. The net effect was that we were generally within sight of each other. The rider density was such that you couldn't simply stick together. If an opening appeared, someone would fill it. Around mile ten we reached the first long climb. I wasn't geared low enough, so I rode it briskly, and in the process, lost my riding companion. Rather than stop and wait, I soft pedaled for a mile or so, thinking that we would reconnect on the ensuing downhill.

When I'd reached the top of the next small uphill, I decided to wait pull over and wait. In a weird sequence of events, Ugur must have passed me just as I dismounted. For the next ten or fifteen minutes, I scanned the sea of riders for his now familiar Turkish national team kit. Nothing. I finally had to concede that he was either ahead of me or had suffered a catastrophic mechanical. When he didn't answer his phone, I decided that he'd somehow slipped ahead of me and was *gone*.

For a moment, I despaired. The thought of spending eighty-eight miles alone was not appealing to me. I wouldn't have even been at the start of the race if it wasn't for a pact, then broken, that promised a weekend of fun and friendship. This year's Almanzo was not about racing, and almost not even about riding bikes.

I began a search for either Ugur or replacement friends. "Hey, have you seen my Turkish friend?" I asked. When I asked Jessica B., the rider directly behind her blurted out, "You know Ugur!"

"Yes! Have you seen him?"

"No. I think he's in front of me."

I decided to ride with this group. It seemed promising. I knew a couple of the riders, had stumbled across a friend and neighbor of my original companion, and was now traveling at a more leisurely pace.

For the next fifteen miles or so, I remained close to this group. As we neared Preston, I decided to ride the final miles into town on my own. They seemed undecided about stopping. I figured that if I rode hard into Preston, I'd be able to reconnect with them on the climb up Jay. After settling on greasy potatoes and a bottle of Coke (hah ha! how sad the compulsions of the food deprived rider), I left the store to find that my new friends had also stopped at the grocery store. *Perfect*.

I lounged around, enjoying the wonderful day. They were ready to go, so I followed. We crossed some water, got muddy, rode some hills, and did all of the things that make the event both fun and challenging. It was nice to be fifty miles into it and *not* be feeling completely shelled. Outside of Preston is typically where over-exertion culminates in a catastrophic bonk. This year, since I was riding almost an hour slower than the previous year, I felt great.

We rolled into the state park where Murray and friends had a buffet of tasty treats waiting for us. Since I rode easy and temporarily relinquished my dietary habits, I probably gained weight over the course of the day. Oh well! It was easily the best Forestville stop ever. *Easily*. My  adopted group of friends now considered me part of their group and called out as they were about to leave. I was much more inclined to lazily sit around than they were. Nonetheless, I mustered all of my resolve and left the friendly confines of the park.

We did more of the riding up hills and through loose gravel and all of that stuff. I was enjoying myself. A new addition to the route was a beer stop around mile eighty(?). I did not have any beer, but grabbed another can of Coke. It was race day! Sort of. Whatever, jumbo.

We rode the final miles back into Spring Valley. I have no idea where I placed or what sort of time I posted. My Garmin died with about five miles remaining. At mile 97, my pedaling time was 6h48m, while my elapsed time was almost two *hours* longer than that! That's how you ride a ultra-chill Almanzo 100 and make new friends.

In hindsight, I should have known something unexpected and weird would happen. It seems to happen that way each year. I'm glad that this year it was for the greater cause of fun, friendship, and community.
