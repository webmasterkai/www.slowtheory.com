It is a cool Thursday afternoon, and I am relaxing. This is in stark contrast to the relentlessly hot days filled with work, work, work. I went to the dentist this morning. Most of my major dental work is done, but I do have a few minor things to address. Today was cleaning and declaration of a *plan*. My last cleaning--six months ago--was at the U of M dental school, with a student who had yet to develop the very desirable qualities of *finesse* and *concern for the comfort of others*. It was my most painful dental experience to date, outshining even emergency root canals and tooth extractions. This time I went to the same place that did my crowns and wisdom teeth. It was great. Due to near-religious daily flossing, my gum health has improved dramatically, to the point where she uttered, "*perio looks good.*" Yeah.  
  
The house situation is coming along nicely. We've had our inspection, re-negotiated the terms of the offer, and are on track for an August 31st closing date. We still need to hammer out a bit of paperwork, but it is all seeming very real. This reality has elicited a certain nervous excitement. It is thrilling, but laden with a degree of anxiousness. Oh shit. Act adult. Bank account. Blah blah blah.  
  
It is a state of transition. I am living very temporarily, with only my most essential items immediately at my disposal. I like the streamlined feel of it, the idea that I am not buried under a hulking mass of possessions. I look at the little corner of the garage where the rest of my things are and it pleases me. The heap could certainly be smaller, and once spread out will convincingly represent the possessions of a very average thirty-one year, but all boxed and tidy it makes my life seem orderly and unwedded to geography or space. It feels like the kind of smallness and nakedness that will allow me to grow harmoniously within the new space of our house and our life.  
  
It was a struggle to write this. My mind has not been fertile with ideas or contemplation. No, it has been busy making lists, enumerating and making efficient. Doing, doing, doing. I need to take more time to simply sit and think.
