Prior to today I had no idea there was a town called Loretto in Minnesota. After wasting most of the morning waiting for the rain to stop, I finally motivated myself to get outside for a bike ride. My goal was to ride for about three hours, explore some new roads, and make sure that I found some nice open areas to allow the wind to punish me a bit. Almanzo is only three weeks away now and I want to be mentally prepared to handle the inevitable strong winds. I haven't been out for a long ride on the tricross in a while, so I also wanted to make sure that I had everything set up correctly. I set it up as I intend to for the race:

Light and fast. Highlighted Almanzo modifications include the ortlieb seatbag and the 12-32 IRD cassette. I put quite a few snacks, my repair stuff, wallet, and cell phone in the ortlieb bag and still had room to spare. It will be more than sufficient for race day. Three water bottles will also be awesome. My specialized borough tires are starting to get a bit worn, so I'll probably replace them with matching 700x42 tires. They won't be the fastest, but I'm not really going there to win and they'll ensure that I'm equipped even if conditions are loose or soft. I started on the Luce Line, venturing out on to the roads just after 494. They weren't particularly thrilling but it's always a bit more engaging riding new places. I headed northwest into a mean crosswind until I reached 19 just north of Loretto.

Turning south I had an amazing tailwind. Cruising at 26-30mph on 32mm tires was nothing special (going into the same wind at 14mph was more difficult). It was a nice reward for suffering early in the ride. I was quickly back on the Luce Line.

Around mile forty I started to feel uncomfortable and tired. It was odd. A couple weeks ago Ryan and I covered seventy miles singlespeed at an only slightly slower speed and I felt much better. I was surprised and a bit dejected, especially considering that I had at least twelve miles left to ride. My legs and lower back were sore and I was shifting around a lot on my saddle.

I felt better by the time I got home, but I think something about my setup is off. My saddle might be too far rearward or too high. I'll have to take some measurements and compare. In any case, it was a nice ride and I found at least a couple of roads that could work their way into the regular route rotation if I can find better connector roads.
