**Weather:** 22F at the start. 29F by the end with light snow.  
**Distance: **20.2 miles + some bonus  
**Time: **a while      
  
**Notes: **Michelle and I decided to do our last long run together. We started the day by sleeping in and then spending two hours eating the most amazing breakfast, highlighted by smoothies and oat groats. I ate *a lot*. Once the food had settled we headed out. The first leg brought us from her house to downtown via the river road. I had built in three stops. This would make a bit more like a *touring* run. Six and a half miles from the start we reached the Downtown Market on 2nd. We rehydrated and continued through downtown. A bunch of people were handing out chocolates on Hennepin. *Weird*. I took one. The next leg was from downtown to my house via the Cedar Lake trail and Lake of the Isles. This was the worst section for me. The slight uphill going back toward Calhoun coupled with the expansiveness of the trail worked against me and I had to just blur my vision and keep running. Once we reached Lake of the Isles the remaining distance to my house seemed fairly easy. We stopped for snacks and water. It was a nice break. The last leg was between my house and Michelle's house via Minnehaha. After about a mile the food kicked in and I felt great. Surprisingly, this feeling lasted. I made a couple navigational mistakes at the end that added some distance, but otherwise everything went exactly as planned. Aside from some soreness in my right knee, I felt wonderful returning to Michelle's house. Definitely one of my best long runs ever.
