We left saturday evening to cool temperatures, calm air and abundant sunshine. I could not have imagined a more perfect night for bicycles and camping. The loose plan was to ride to the snake river campground, camp, turn around in the morning and ride home. Two of the original four people called early-afternoon to say that wouldn't be able to make it. Not enough time to get ready. I was looking forward to a large group, but alas, it's the nature of things. Alex arrived at the shop at 5pm. Since the size of the group had dwindled we decided on a route that was about thirty percent shorter. I had packed light: a hammock, twenty degree sleeping bag (I was expecting to be farther north where the temperatures would be in the mid forties overnight), headlamp, knife, pants, shirt, bethmade-cookies, bagels, cantaloupe, tuna sandwich, three water bottles, matches, and a few other miscellaneous items. No stove, cookwear, pillow, etc. We headed south with the general idea of crossing the river at Prescott, WI. Traffic was light. Our shadows stretched out across the pavement as the sun began its descent. Soon it was dark and we were riding by the white glow of our LEDs. The moon hovered above, a small sliver in a sky full of stars. It had been a long time since I'd seen the stars. Here it is only the ambient glow of the city. We traveled fast. Down dirt roads lined with corn fields. As we neared the kinnikinnick river we started searching for a place to camp. After winding our way down more than one mile long driveway only to end up in someone's front lawn, we found our way into the park by crawling under a locked fence. It was deserted. The clear, cold night reminded me of the night that we met. I strung my hammock, gazed at the stars and lost myself to dreaming. It seemed like only minutes had passed. I woke up to headlights. They lingered on us. I was disappointed, thinking that we would be asked to leave the park. I didn't relish the thought of packing up in the middle of the night and trying to find another place to sleep. But just as quickly they were gone. They either didn't see us (unlikely) or didn't care. I hope that it was the latter. We would be gone in the morning. No one would know that we were there. It's funny how difficult it is, even in this sparsely populated place to find a place to sleep at night. I woke up to my alarm. Too early. Went back to sleep. It was almost 8am by the time that I woke up. I slept amazingly well. I might still have been there at noon if Alex didn't have to get to work. We took a shorter route back through Hudson, stopping only to get coffee and breakfast. We returned with just over one hundred miles. I had a lot of fun. I also learned the Alex is secretly a much stronger rider than me. He hides things like this. Amazing talents. Objects. It has been interesting getting to know him better. It was a wonderful adventure, and placed within a timeframe that required no special accommodation. I need to do more of this.
