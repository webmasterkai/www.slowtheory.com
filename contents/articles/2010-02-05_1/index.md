thursday I took the other lrt out past excelsior. it was in fantastic condition compared to the icy deathmaze to the south. aside from some bumpiness near lake minnetonka, it would have easily been rideable on cyclocross tires sans studs. I pretty much just had to point my pugsley in the right direction and pedal. the fog yielded precipitation that wasn't quite snow or rain. it stuck to my pogies and jacket, forming slick sheets of ice that made a noise like tissue paper when I moved my torso. I pushed harder than I have in a while and completed the almost forty mile ride in under three hours. in the world of me riding a pugsley at 9psi, that is flying.
