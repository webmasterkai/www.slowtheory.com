It was a strange week. Rollercoaster. Several days of not sleeping enough. I felt braindead going into today. I didn't even know what was planned. I normally make the sunday plans, but not this week. This week everyone knew that I didn't even have the ability to watch the sun move across the livingroom floor. Poor preparation. Woke up hungry and did almost nothing about it. I found out that the plan was to go to Minnehaha and see if there was enough water for rafting. We stopped at Longfellows on the way because I was only twenty minutes into the day and ready to tip over. The waitress was charismatic. She described one of the specials in such lurid, almost sexual detail that I could not help but order it. It was good. After lunch I ordered chocolate cake and ice cream. Hah! I celebrated like it was my fucking birthday, which it was not. Chocolate cake and ice cream, seriously. I wanted to plant a candle in the middle of it and laugh like a madman. Fucking ridiculous life. We left. I still felt like shit. We pedaled. Familiar things passed by me. The wind did something. The sun was mostly obscured. "I guess it is technically mostly cloudy, because there are mostly clouds." Nod head. Focus. Paw at the spot of sunlight creeping its way across my bedroom floor. It is dark in my mind. There wasn't enough water in the creek for rafting, or anything really, except possibly walking. We went to plan B: bikeraft from the southern shore of Calhoun to Brownie lake. I'm not sure if that was originally plan B, but it's what we did. It was the first time that I attached a bike to my boat, and I fucked up in a variety of amusing ways. For instance, I pointed the crankarm such that I had to straddle it with one of my legs almost falling out of the boat. As we neared Lake of the Isles I finally stopped to fix that problem. I also positioned my bike so that it was tipping my boat slightly to one side. It made it awkward to paddle in a straight line. (There is a fucking car alarm that has been going off for about twenty minutes in three minute bursts) I learned a lot about bikerafting. For instance, taking a bike over class iv rapids would be stupid. Aside from making me a bit slow, it worked great on still water. At Brownie lake we reassembled our bikes, packed up our boats, and headed down the cedar lake trail towards home. I had fun. I felt exhausted even though everything about today was completely leisurely. I wonder if I have mono, depression, overtiredness, or anemia.
