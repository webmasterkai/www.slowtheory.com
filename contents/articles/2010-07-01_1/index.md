June was a difficult month logistically, emotionally, and psychologically. As a result I shifted much of my focus to running and lifting weights. While cycling is fulfilling, the chemical response in the brain to running and weights is much more satisfying. I'd also like to keep my fitness more evenly balanced. On a positive note, I'm enjoying my new commute and had a great (albeit challenging) time at the Dirty Benjamin.
