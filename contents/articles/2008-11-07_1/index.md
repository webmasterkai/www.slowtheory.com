Winter inches nearer. I try only to keep my mind awake, not stimulated or purpose-driven, only awake. It is an effort. The infinite permutations of wet, gray, cold and windy, on the surface seeming nearly endless. I end my days with a beer and boredom, peering out at a reflection of my infinite idiocy. 

There is new hope. I see it. Yes, I see it. So desperately spoken. So softly. I wonder sometimes at the strange way in which people accumulate people, like army figurines. Social networking networks full of people who do not speak to each other. It is a statement, after all, when one has this or that many "friends". Of the people on my list, how many anticipate any type of communication whatsoever? Three? Five? Seven? 

When I was destroying my past I found letters that I had written to a person I've never met. I also found some of the letters that he had written me. It was so beautifully earnest. So unlike this blog or my mind or that conversation. This is what I have been doing. This is what I have been thinking. This is the person I saw on the way home from work today. This is how people act at the grocery store where I shop. This is the time of day when I wake up and the time of day when I go to bed. The numbers are this color on my alarm clock. This is what I ate for dinner last night. It was freedom in writing them, and a pity that I was often too lazy to send them. I am cleaning up my life. 

I am simplifying, limiting my possessions. Every day I either prepare one item for donation, sale or the trash. When I encounter an item that is unsettling I move on, certain that I will return to it when I am more comfortable. It is painful at times, to remove from my life even something that I do not use or think about, or even something that when thought about elicits nothing but a feeling of gloom. How attached we become to our artifacts! I have a brown bag in my closet that I am sure I will not be able to eliminate. How could I? I know that I could not. I wonder if it's the money that lives inside of the bag or if it's only the proof that I once stood strong and proud. 

And I begin acting...or meditating. Dreaming. Irreverently blissful. When I was younger. Of course. Of course. Don't say that. When I was in my early twenties I exchanged a series of emails with one of my cousins. They spanned many topics but inevitably returned to god and/or sex. How inhumane. The despair. The dissolution. The indignity and humility. I wonder (I want) it all to be for some reason. A quick (slow) painful lesson in the futility of communication to situate oneself as an immortal. 

I began to write as though everyone could see the words that I strung together. It was maddening to think that I'd made a mistake. Oh no, not structurally! The structure of the mind at its most fluid is a mistake. Instead I grew insane over the notion that I had produced an idea outside of the scope of reasonable consciousness. How badly I wanted to be creative while maintaining my safety in ordinariness. So I started over and made sure that no one was watching. In my despair I hoped only for one set of eyes to mistake my suffering for brilliance and my suffering for suffering. Hah ha. 

I promise to write, she said. 

I promise to write, he said. 

He might have for a while. So too might she have written at least one letter and answered another. But the words lacked the vibrancy of something freely given from the tongue and the throat. The words and thoughts of a computer. A microchip. A computer could be made to simulate the function of a particular human being in a particular mood, and, of course, robots can be rebuilt with the same parts. 

I reread a letter that I received from a girl named Krista. It is one of my favorite letters. It was a brilliant. Half typed on a typewriter. Half scribbled in ink. Signed wildly, passionately. What had been an innocent infatuation grew into something terrifying and sickening, because I knew that it was not real. My resources, sense and faculty was committed to a ghostly notion, to a person I'd never met and never would. I planned to visit her once and did not go. I do not know why I didn't go. I had a school obligation, but it could have been circumvented. She married some time ago. I remember seeing the photos and thinking how beautifully matched she was to her partner. 

I began cleaning my room. It must be somehow responsible for the fact that I am dreaming no differently than I did years ago. It is if this time has passed in stasis. 

A screaming child breaks the silence. 

Marina. Marcela. How badly I wanted both of you to be brilliant socialists, and how down I found myself when you each showed yourself to be spoiled princesses.
