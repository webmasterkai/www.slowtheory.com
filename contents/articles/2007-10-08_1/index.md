#### Friday around 10:30am 

I'm waiting, bags packed, for Ryan to finish his packing. Outside the sky is a dull gray and water splashes noisily down the gutter. My left achilles is a bit sore but otherwise I feel like I'm in good working order. 

I have little to write about and even less to talk about these days. I've noticed that people have stopped asking me the types of questions that facilitate topicless conversation. Part of the problem is that you can't talk about any one topic too intensely or frequently. The conversation has to be generic and easily transported from one situation to the next. This is especially difficult as I tend to revisit the same irresolvable topics that flourish more in their conflict than in their resolution. In this way they are intense and must be applied with moderation. 

In two days it will be time to run a marathon. Over one year of psychosis has been devoted to this self contained struggle. I have selected the implements... 

#### Friday 8:28pm 

I am in Milwaukee now. The city is different than I remember, but I haven't been here since I was a boy and my parents took me to see the Twins play the Brewers at the old stadium. 

The new stadium was immediately visible from the interstate--­a hulking mass of irons that extended up above the horizon like a forbidden city. As we moved into its grasp it grew progressively more industrial, with cranes and intricately woven bridges littering the landscape. We stopped abruptly. The automatic doors to the hotel opened the wrong direction, threatening to smack an inattentive guest in the face. The woman at the front desk repeatedly asked how to spell "Brown". 

Outside a girl in a loose fitting red dress, hair heaped in dreads walked barefoot in front of the Speakeasy. The city felt lawless, seized in a moment of calm before night would set and chaos would ensue. 

Shortly after getting out of the car I developed an intense pain that ran from my neck to the bottom of my shoulder blade, most thoroughly aggravated whilst turning my head or raising my right arm. I stretched, took a shower and swallowed three alieve with little effect. 

We walked past city hall, completely encased in scaffolding, distinguished only by a sign posted on a chainlink fence reading "Entrance to City Hall". The complexity of the scaffolding was awe inspiring. It extended hundreds of feet into the air and surrounded the building such that it was not clear whether the structure was standing any longer of its own volition. 

#### Saturday morning 

It's Saturday morning. I had difficulty sleeping last night as unpleasant noises kept assaulting me, the worst of which was from an automobile that kept circling our block, blasting some kind of weird pop music that incorporated repeated "yea yea yeas" and deep bass sounds. Interestingly, in my grogginess it seemed that the precise noise and instance in time repeated itself on each of two occasions. It took some effort to fall back asleep. Spirits seem generally low. 

#### Saturday 6:42pm 

Went in search of bagels for tomorrow morning. The "Grand Ave Market" was far less grand that one might have expected. Mostly they had old and discontinued products that came in packets and boxes. There was nothing like a bagel--­not even a pastry--­so we moved on our way. Just down the street there was a second Market that looked very much the same and added only porn and liquor to the selection. Ryan commented that many of the products were heavily marked up products that Aldi had discontinued from their stores. 

Dunkin Donuts surprisingly had a fairly wide selection of bagels. The trip back to the hotel was perilous as carrying anything in downtown Milwaukee makes one an especially tantalizing target for the panhandlers. We had been thus far assaulted on every block by men seeking handouts. One did so with such laziness and carelessness that he shouted at us through bus stop plexiglass. We positioned ourselves behind two well dressed women and tried to remain invisible. 

Earlier in the day we were killing time, waiting to check back into the hotel. I marked this passage in Dead Souls: 

> The author is a quandary how to name these two ladies without rousing anger as on previous occasions. To invent names for them would be dangerous. However fictitious the name, there will always be someone in some out-of-the-way corner of our empire­--rightly called great­--who will lay some claim to it, fly into a deadly rage, and start proclaiming that the author had paid a secret visit with the express purpose of finding out who he was and what sort of sheepskin coat he wore, what Agrafena Ivanovna he visited and what food he preferred. If, Heaven forbid, any reference is made to a person's rank, the peril is even greater. Nowadays people of rank and condition are so touchy that any character in a book is at once liable to be taken for a living person; such apparently is the general mood and atmosphere. It is enough to say that there is a stupid man in some town and he is at once embodied in a living person: of a sudden, a gentleman of respectable appearance will leap out and yell: `I am a man too, and therefore stupid!' In short, he will instantly grasp what it is all about. (Gogol 191) 

The book is very clever. 

I don't like the city of Milwaukee. Most of the population here seems largely unaware and unsympathetic to the fact that there is a marathon happening tomorrow. I wouldn't be surprised if a host of angry motorists, bass thumping, found their way on to the course tomorrow. Next year if I run a marathon I'm going to be on top of my game and get registered for the Twin Cities version before registration fills. On the plus side, we received bitchin' coolmax long sleeved running shirts as part of our registration packet. 

#### Monday 5:50pm 

My alarm christened Sunday morning with its meowing cat sometime around 4:30am. I rolled out of bed, ate a crusty bagel and arranged my things, ticking off each item in my head like a Barbie doll accessory­--shirt, shoes, harden the fuck up wristband, and so on. 

After stretching and pinning my race number to the bare skin on my right thigh, I looked myself in the mirror. I sort of looked like a runner. 

The streets of Milwaukee were strangely desolate at 5:40am. Thugs were not roaming the streets and I did not feel as though I was situated at the confluence of hellish bass rifts that originated deep within the earth. Two blocks from the hotel I spied an xtracycle locked to a sign. The sight of it made me giddy. 

The buses finally arrived and some clever deductive reasoning allowed that there would not be nearly enough room for all of the runners. We lined up and forced our way on to the bus until people were densely packed in the seats and aisle from front to rear. Seeing that the situation was hopeless I looked around for the smallest people I could find who were sitting two to a seat. "Do you mind of I sit here?" I asked, gesturing to the three inch space at the edge of the seat. The two women quickly agreed and shuffled over, but not wanting to be a jerk I only took as much space as was absolutely necessary. 

After an hour of pacing nervously around the Grafton High School we lined up to start. The intensity of the sun seemed to double by the minute. Temperatures were expected to be in the mid-eighties with dew points hovering in the upper seventies. After being held fast to the ground by a less than rousing rendition of the national anthem the gun sounded and I made the first real motions with my feet. The crowd surged and pulsed a few times and finally let loose. I was covered with sweat almost immediately. 

I wanted to maintain a fairly consistent pace throughout the run, with the first few miles and the last few being a bit slower than everything in between. After a mile I was beginning to wonder if we were going to finish dead last given the rate at which people were passing us. Much to my surprise though, people were at the side of the road walking within two miles. I'm not sure if this was their strategy or if they had underestimated the effect that the warm weather would have on their performance, but it seemed odd. 

The course was rather uneventful. We were far enough from Lake Michigan that the splendid and continuous view of the lake that I had imagined was not realized until the 23rd mile. Mostly it was dull countryside. 

Everything pretty much went according to plan. Given the circumstances, we were doing great with the pace and it was with increased frequency that we were passing by people who had hit an early wall. By the thirteenth mile it was only the occasional relay participant that went zooming by with an inexplicable freshness that forced my eyes to their ass to see if it was adorned with a bright pink RELAY sign. Almost all of the time, it was. 

It must have been somewhere around mile ten that we encountered the black mammoth. He was wearing knee high stockings, layered shorts and a du-rag and shouting encouragement to anyone with visual range of him. He must have weighed close to 250 pounds and had an ambling gait that was more like a rapid hobble than running. He surged forward unexpectedly and then dropped back. This repeated several times before we finally left him behind. 

At about mile sixteen the heat became overwhelming. The tar seemed to be melting under my feet and the runner to walker ratio must have been 1:3. People were fading fast and the sound of ambulances could be heard in either direction. I drank as much as I could at each aid station, grabbing as many glasses as my hands would hold. 

At mile twenty-two the lake suddenly appeared, we descended a long hill and the temperature dropped ten degrees. It was just what I needed and I started to feel much better. Around mile twenty-five I felt an incredible burst of energy. I knew that I was going to make it. The final 1.2 miles were like a victory lap. I passed my family who had been volunteering at the event, giving my dad the thumbs up. I crossed the finish line and drank a soda.
