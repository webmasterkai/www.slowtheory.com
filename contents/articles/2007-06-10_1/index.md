heads and hands elsewhere  
downward  
indecorous description of the taste of oral occupation  
my my  
hadn't absorbed but in an instant  
your disappointed eye  
glaring green bloody cold  
it wasn't that good  
elaborating with cogent detail  
on the  
liability imposed  
thinly  
of timorous volcanic  
insobriety  
I touch it with my finger  
pass it in front of my nose  
nothing  
or nothing  
meditate on this world  
comprised of textures  
and little else  
you are three people  
of my choosing  
hah  
hah  
hah
