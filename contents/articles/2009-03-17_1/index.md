Spring is here. Three consecutive days of not losing money at the bike shop. I stopped at the grocery store to pick up zyrtec. Not yet. But soon. Things are coming to life. Dave is still hesitant. 'No, it's not spring yet.' Fuck that. It's spring. I declare it on the internet. Booming voice. Provocative posture. Beaming. The fad of spring will pass. I miss pre-spring. Like adolescence. On the brink of adult cares without being engulfed by them. Sexually aroused but free from the psychological and practical complexities inherent in its execution (your execution). Long days. Seemingly always hungry and getting plumper. Softer. Pedal. Lift. Mentally waxen. I slept great last night until 4:37am at which point I awoke to a bowl of cereal and facebook. Interneting. Reading words. One out of three passing out of my mind. Reread the message when I awake again at 7:30am finding it completely different, though no more or less articulate and enchanting. Avoid K-. Josef. And so on. Execution. I'm being friendlier! I'm talking better! Shit. I stammered. But it's okay because we're minutes into the conversation. It's acceptable at this point. Forgetting paperwork. Swapping mechanicalalities. Am I talking louder? My pants are shorter, that's for sure.

I couldn't sleep after waking up. Morning. Sneeze. Coffee. Whatever. My Hawaii beans are gone and these small idiotic beans pale/dark in comparison.
