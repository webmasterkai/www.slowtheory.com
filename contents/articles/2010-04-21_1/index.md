I have had terrible luck with ten speed chains on bikes that are ridden in less than stellar conditions. After the last chain on my tricross reached the limit of its tolerable elongation after around 200 miles, I freaked out and put nine speed components on it. The nine speed stuff was clunky, noisy and obviously not the answer I was looking for. After one ride I removed it and put the ten speed stuff back on, intent on finding a solution to my premature chain wear. I'll admit that 1.) I do not often clean my chain, and 2.) I ride in shitty conditions and will periodically slam my cassette face down into a sandy beach while loading my packraft. my new solution: try to be a little bit better about caring for my drivetrain, but more importantly, experiment with different lubes and chains to find the best compromise. First up: SRAM pc1050 with Pedro's ChainJ chain lube to the long side of the chain wear indicator.
