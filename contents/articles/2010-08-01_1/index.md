July was about much more than bicycles. I began to feel more capable and equipped to deal with the rigors of everyday existence. I met new people. I tried new things. I exposed myself to vulnerability and learned to dismiss and indulge my ego at appropriate times (at least, most of the time). I made time for other hobbies including books, films, running and weight lifting. I accepted that certain facets of my life are not in my control, that they can remain imperfect and it will be *fine*. tomorrow. tomorrow. *you are important to me. we are potential and possibility.*  
  
but I nonetheless made time to enjoy bicycles. I have a good chance at the 10,000 mile year that I set my sights on at the beginning of the year. in spite of the general meaninglessness of that figure, it would still be a thrilling achievement.
