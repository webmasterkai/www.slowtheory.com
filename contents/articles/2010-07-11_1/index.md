During the past three weeks I've done very little non-essential cycling. Several factors have contributed including an aversion to hot weather, general fatigue, reinvestment in running, and dealing with life issues. Last night I decided that it was time to get back into it. Jeff and I met at the bike shop with a plan to do the afton loop. We took it pretty easy and rode at a pace that allowed for easy conversation. It was a nice way to get back into it.  
  
When I got home I watched the end of the tour stage, had a cup of coffee and took a nap.  
  
Later I went to fogo de chao. We looked like regular adults and ate some fantastic food.  
  
After that I watched greenberg. Excellent movie. Noah Baumbach is brilliant at capturing something fundamentally disconnecting about the human experience.  
  
Can't ask for much more than that from a Sunday.
