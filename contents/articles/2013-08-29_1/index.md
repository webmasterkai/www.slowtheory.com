Since I'm out of the bike business until either next spring or the end of time, I decided to become a person with an excessive and nearly preposterous quasi-bike shop nestled away in the basement. I've often subjected friends and peers who have embarked on a similar journey to cruel and obnoxious jeering. "*Why?*"", I would ask with a haughty air, "Do you really need such a thing?" My notion was rooted in the idea that you should do nothing if you cannot do everything. Very few people have the financial resources or commitment to spend the necessary $5k+ on a complete bike shop in a box. Spoiled by unfettered access to the real thing, any home derivative seemed patently inadequate. Well, humility struck me in the form of no longer having reign over any real bike shop. I had erroneously assumed that I would always be able to go back to old shops, joyously ushered through the door, led to an open stand, handed a beer, and most thoroughly accommodated both pragmatically and existentially. While I remain on generally friendly terms with my old shops, the realization that I was **only** an employee and it was just a job strikes a backhanded blow. A person always wants to write a better narrative than that, but really, we're all mostly doing the same thing: trading time for money, and using other people to do less of the one for more of the other. At least I can fix bikes in my underwear nowâ€¦when the roommates aren't home, at least.

The impetus was this: I went to the dentist last week. Over the past two years I've been slowly working my way back to good dental health. When I began the journey, I was plagued by poor habits and a genetic predisposition to *decay*. I've now flossed at least once a day for over 500 consecutive days, repaired almost all of my cavities, and replaced a handful of my questionable fillings with crowns. I have one more appointment next Tuesday, after which I will be in the best condition that I've been in since my first cavity at the age of sixteen. Because of my "situation", I've gotten to know my dentist pretty well. Occasionally we have taken the opportunity to swap skills&amp;resources--he fixes some of my teeth, and I fix his bike. So while I had already come to the realization that I needed a bike repair space for myself, friends, and family, the further justification found in trading my skills greatly contributed to the transformation from idea to action. So, I bought some stuff. A truing stand, bottom bracket stuff, headset stuff, derailleur alignment stuff, stuff for that other *ding-dong*. I built a frame for some pegboard, hung some things, installed a powerstrip and tweaked the lighting. I swept the floor. I stood back, admired the thing that I made, found Michelle, dragged her downstairs to "look at it", appreciated her feigned enthusiasm, and spun a wheel just to see how long it would turn. It was pretty good.
