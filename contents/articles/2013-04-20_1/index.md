*UPDATE*: Results posted <a href="http://www.andersonraces.com/_uls/resources/tm50ksolors2013.pdf">Here</a>. I'm currently listed as 22nd place, but suspect I might actually be 19th (the 62 year old in second place shaved 3 hours off of his time from last year).

The alarm went off at 4am. *I just want to sleep another half hour,* I muttered. The original plan was to ride my bike to Uptown, connect with Justin, Jessica, and Murray, and carpool to the race start in Bloomington. Since I wanted to sleep another thirty minutes, I roused Michelle from her peaceful slumber and asked her to drive me to Uptown in an hour. She very coherently replied that if I'd just let her know twenty minute before the desired departure time, she'd be happy to take me. We later reflected on this conversation, and in spite of her very sensible and relevant response, she didn't understand what I was asking. She thought the agreement was that she would sleep longer. Longer than what? Not sure.

In spite of not understanding the plan, or that she had agreed to take part in it, we were ready to go at exactly the time that google maps suggested we needed to be. However, my failure to clear the driveway after the plow went by for the second time resulted in our car being completely stuck. I was pissed. I was mostly upset at myself for creating a situation where I might miss another race. Michelle called Justin while I ran to get a shovel. The sidewalk was frozen over and jogging back to the car I slipped and fell hard on my back. I laid there for a moment, assessing the damage. There was a sharp pain in my elbow, my hand was bleeding, and my tailbone hurt. I cursed. A lot. I wouldn't say that I'm a person who usually doesn't curse, but it was very unlike me. I must have sounded like a lunatic. 

To make matters worse, the chunks of snow had turned into nearly immovable masses of snow and ice. We chipped away at them for quite a while before the car could finally be extracted from the driveway. The new plan was that Michelle would drive me to the start of the race rather than Justin's house.

I reached the Visitor's Center with time to spare. It now seemed silly that I was on the verge of mental and emotional breakdown. I picked up my timing chip and race number. I noticed a few very cool things about this event.

- I didn't get a shirt. There was a table of shirts, but I think maybe they were for sale?
- The race packet was a "virtual race packet" that consisted of a PDF with coupons for products sold by the race sponsors.
- They were composting and using compostable cups at the aid stations.
- The price of admission was a very reasonable $40ish.

I would never argue that holding an event where people drive to the start, run around in circles using disposable *stuff*, and then drive home is a *smart* or *profitable* thing for the environment, but I appreciated that they seemed to be occupying a middle ground between the completely unsupported underground scene and the obscenely priced, marketing fiasco that is most running events. All of this, while exhibiting a strong probability of a social conscience...Anyway, I digress.

My race number was 50. I joked with lady handing out the timing chips (also reusable!) that I had selected it based on my race distance. She was unimpressed. I brought my drop bag to the start and waited for the race to start.

(Times include stops…lap three was actually more like 1h08m moving time, or *too fast*)

####Lap 1 - 1h17m53s

We started on a paved section. I thought, *Oh, I can probably do this for 30 miles*. After a couple miles, we turned on to the first trail section, at which point I thought, "No one is going to finish this race." The trail was not groomed. We were just post-holing our way through four inches of snow. Footing was uneven, my heartrate spiked, and I just focused on doing the one thing that I could do: move forward. The trail section was long, but we eventually found ourselves back on pavement. This lasted a short time, and then we were back on the trail. This section had received some kind of traffic and had sections that were vaguely more runnable. 

The loop finished with a bit more pavement. Once back at my drop bag I took a moment to refuel. Since the loops were only 7.75 miles, my plan was to be generous with my breaks and make sure that I had the fuel that I needed to keep going.

####Lap 2 - 1h18m23s

After the first loop, I had been quietly indulging the notion of just doing two laps and calling it a day. However, on the second loop the trails were somewhat improved. The 25km participants had packed it down a bit, so running the off-road was much less awkward and laborious. I focused on conserving energy and taking time to appreciate the beauty around me. The day was bright and clear, and the rare late-April snow offered stunning views (if views in Bloomington can be described as "stunning"). I rolled to the start of the third lap feeling good.

####Lap 3 - 1h16m54s

This was the lap where I made some mistakes. The challenge was this: I was catching the slow 25km runners. There were not just a few runners scattered about the countryside…no, no, after only about the first quarter of the lap there were long lines of runners. It was inspiring and cool to see, but it did present a very real logistical problem: I had to pass all of these people. Generally, they did not move off of the trail, so this meant expending energy in the fluffy snow to either side. For a while this was fun, but I could tell that I was paying a price for the extra effort. I was also not drinking as much water as I should have. I was running with a hydration pack to ensure that I'd have ample opportunity to drink, but the inconsistent effort resulted in me failing to stay on top of my hydration. Toward the end of the lap I caught up with Justin, and then Jessica. It was cool to see friends and gave me a big boost going into the fourth lap.

####Lap 4 - 1h34m13s

The mistakes that I made on the third lap caught up to me quickly. I felt nauseous and my effort to re-hydrate just left my belly sloshing with liquid. Around mile 26 I started mixing in walking with running. This lasted through mile 29 when my efforts to correct my hydration mistakes starting to pay dividends. I ran the last mile and a half or two miles and finished feeling pretty good. I knew the final miles would be an unknown, having never run that distance before, so I was pleased with my effort.

Overall, it was a really well executed race and a ton of fun. I wasn't thrilled with the amount of asphalt on the course, but perhaps that was due to weather related rerouting…not sure.
