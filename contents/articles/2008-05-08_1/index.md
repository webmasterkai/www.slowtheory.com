In honor of the first of may I received a knife from one of my knife wielding friends. The handle is the same shade of blue as many of the toys that I had when I was a child. In fact, I think it's the same shade of blue as some of the tricycles that we sell at work. It seems somehow appropriate, as if the childish hue of its handle will somehow accompany me into the wild world of cutlery. Initially I wasn't sure what I should do with it. Carry it with me at all times like my insane knife friend? No--not only is that not my style, but I have a difficult time not misplacing my keys and wallet. Leave it in my xtracycle? No--too dangerous. So for a few days it sat in its plastic sheath on my desk. Then it occurred to me that I use knives in the kitchen, and not only do I use knives in the kitchen, I use shitty knives in the kitchen. Surely my playskool colored, made in sweden knife would be able to slice a ham better than a shitty knife! And it did! And then earlier this evening I diced raw chicken with it. Someday I might use it to cut a cantaloupe, or a pineapple. The possibilities are endless. I think maybe I've underestimated knives.

Yesterday a rather portly woman came into the bike shop and announced that she was starting a new business in the area. She asked if she could leave some cards on the counter. The pacifist's method of dealing with such people is to say yes, wait five minutes, and then drop said items in the recycling bin. My coworkers, blatant pacifists, quickly agreed. When I walked up to the counter I found pink cards that read like a poorly phrased spam email. It read, "LOSE WEIGHT NOW," followed by a serious of buzzwords for dietary supplements and a cellphone number. I was flabbergasted, utterly blown away that she would think it even worth the gas money to drive around in search of someone stupid enough to buy diet pills out of the back of her car. The fact that she could be medically defined as "obese" made it even more stupefying. 

On the way home from work I saw three people in electric wheelchairs. Two of the riders were smoking cigarettes. 

I've been tired lately. I can't decide if I'm a.) simply tired from work, b.) affected by allergies and allergy medication, or c.) ill. When I got home from work I thought that I would either run or bike. I watched jeopardy, intending to decide by the end of the show. By 5:30pm I was still tired and undecided, so I took a forty minute nap. When I woke up I put on my running gear and sat down in a chair. I finally decided to listen to my body and not leave the apartment. Instead I cleaned, did some laundry and made a large dinner for one. After dinner I went to bed. 

During the night I woke up to the sound of people yelling in the parking lot. Two drunk college kids were saying their goodbyes and seemed to have no idea that loud noises can easily travel through two panes of glass. This is a common phenomenon at this apartment. "YOU'RE A BAD INFLUENCE ON ME, ____," one of them shouted. Shut the fuck up. You're a bad influence on my sleep. 

I woke up later than normal. Later, in fact, than I've woken up in months. Maybe ten hours of sleep will fix me.
