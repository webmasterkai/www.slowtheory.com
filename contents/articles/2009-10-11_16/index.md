In the morning I got dirty on the karate monkey. 35x18 this week. a little bit more gear, but it was still pleasantly slow. the wind was ferocious at times, but the small gear kept things normal. easy. turn the pedals and forget about everything. the tick-tick of unlubricated chainring bolts. fantastic dreamy morning. I met jeff and ryan at my old apartment. pedaled around for a couple hours taking every opportunity to detour into the dirt. I found some mud. laughed. enjoyed the cool breeze.

later. BBQ. massivity and consequence. I burned almost everything. the massive charcoal grill required a finesse that I was not able to produce. later in the evening I cooked steak without burning it.
