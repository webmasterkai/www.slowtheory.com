I need to get real Internet here. the ithing is driving me crazy. it was my split shift day, so I had the chance to try three new commuting routes. the first one was awful. fourteen and a half miles and much worse than the direct ten mile route. the second was very nice. long though. fifteen and a half miles. the last was efficient and smart but visually anxious. part of the difficulty is the combination of limited roads that cross the freeway and the many one ways in this part of the city.
