Normally, I wouldn't review a pair of shoes after 63 miles. Unfortunately, this time things are so unambiguous that I needn't log any more miles to pronounce the Instinct 1.5 a poor substitute for its predecessor. I was leery. The subdued, simple, and marvelously efficient aesthetic had been replaced by flash, gaudy branding, and the glow of marketing buzz. Shit. I liked those shoes.

So, it went alright for a couple runs. The fit and feel were pretty good. However, after a 21 mile training run, I glanced at the sides and found that the mesh was shredded. I went online to find that this is a common problem with the 1.5. 

The circuitous path to a resolution went like this:

- Live chat on their website. Of course, I knew this was too easy and wouldn't lead to resolution. He directed me to a phone number that I should call.
- Called and listened to hold music for 10-15 minutes.
- Went back into live chat and confessed that I didn't have the wherewithal to survive the hold time. I was referred to an email address.
- After not receiving a reply for a day, I posted to their Facebook page with photos of my shoes. Their response was super fast and assertive. I was given another email address and assured that the shoes would be replaced.
- Initially, this email interaction was promising. He admitted that my shoes were defective and that many others like it exhibited the same problem. However, responses became slower and less promising, until finally he told me that I'd have to return them to the store.
- Since I hadn't saved the receipt, I emailed Run N Fun to see if they would take a return on a pair of shoes for which I had no proof of purchase. Their response was quick, but brief. They wouldn't take the return as they no longer carried Altra products. They did get me in contact with the local Altra rep.
- The rep contacted me. Initially he insisted on a phone conversation, which I put on my "to do" list, but didn't immediately have the time to make. After I told him that, he backed off on that requirement and said he'd take care of it. 

The takeaway? I'm not sure. I've liked their shoes a lot in the past. I'll give it another chance, but this experience has certainly left a bad impression.
