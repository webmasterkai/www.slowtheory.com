The grape wallpaper had to go. We talked about it for weeks. The conversations revealed strong, albeit completely contradictory, opinions held by anyone who either 1.) owned a house, or 2.) had heard about houses and wallpaper.  
  
"Paint it."  
  
"Don't paint it. It will bubble and expose the seams."  
  
"I have just the tool for it. You need this tool."  
  
"Don't use that tool that people suggest if you have plaster walls."  
  
"Steamer."  
  
"A steamer will ruin your plaster."  
  
"A wet sponge."  
  
"[name of chemical]"  
  
We found ourselves completely overwhelmed and immobolized by this information overload/dissonance. A spreadsheet listing qualifications for each piece of information and its corresponding source revealed nothing. Any, nothing, or all of the things proposed might work or end in disaster. So for a time we did nothing, until the day that Michelle tried what noone had suggested: peel it off. I came home to find shreds of wallpaper strewn about the floor. Anxiously, I probed for an answer to the question--"*What works?*" I expected a device, a method, anything... She told me that she just grabbed a corner and started pulling. I suppose we now have another strong opinion to add to the sea of dissonance--*just pull the shit off*.  
  
Our other project for the weekend was beginning our move to the third floor. We've decided that for a couple of years we're going to rent 2-4 rooms on the second floor. We have too many expensive projects that we want to do on the house to waste the opportunity. It's also a bit lonely in such a large space. Now we just need people.Â
