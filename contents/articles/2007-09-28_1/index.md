this morning I woke up entwined with a phantom bearing the resemblance of a nun captivated on her God and I felt a great suffering for in my dreams it was as though I could not forget anything about her her hair her smile the way that she twisted her face when she was angry with me and the condensation that formed on the ends of her eyelashes in my dream there was an alarming accuracy of sentiment as though years had not passed since the last time that I saw her and when I awoke it was with relief that I found myself once again at a distance unable to perceive with any amount of precision how permanently forged her image remains in my mind yet it will be there when I fall asleep most often forgotten upon waking evidenced only in the scrutiny with which I evaluate the process of aging and the anxiety to which I owe these poorly conceived decisions I wait with trepidation as the radio revolves around a handful of songs that have become mixed with facial expressions and a tendency to reuse for brief lengths of time particular words around which we gravitated like how we used to say come now as one would to a child insistent on perceiving an imaginary slight and occasionally I will meet someone with lips very much like hers and I must restrain myself from allowing a particularity to the accused stranger that is both unfair and unnatural I've lost the respect of everyone I know who almost universally proclaim that I have exceeded the maximum sum of grievance allowed such an injustice so I frown and grow immediately and permanently silent hateful toward anyone brazen enough to suggest that suffering has become my true objective that in fine it is not compassion love and closeness but rather an obsession with martyrdom that fuels my temporal irrelevance this accusation stands to such a degree that I am accused of no longer maintaining sentience or singularity I am now a vague redundancy relieved of respite by a dimensionless mind wedded to an easily directed form eat fucking food fuck fucking she drink fucking water proceed unkindly into midlife grouchiness repeat as necessary the radio plays almost nothing for me anymore wednesdays do not result in a different type of sleeping I memorize even fewer schedules and my phone will often go through two battery cycles before it rings this is my plentiful boundless paradise of being suspicious and arousing suspicion it is autumn and I have truly become a villain my roar of laughter reverberating off of every surface ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha in the end though I slump my shoulders my spine weighted with the supernatural burden of memory and exhale
