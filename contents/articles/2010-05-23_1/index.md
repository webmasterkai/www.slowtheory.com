I found out on Friday that I'm going to get to participate in the [Westside Dirty Benjamin][1] on June 19th. Awesome. I should probably just take a couple months to relax as I often do after working and riding too much in the spring, but the temptation to participate in another gravel road race was too tempting. I haven't decided if I'm going to be competitive (you know, for like...40th place) or if I'm just going to have fun and take it easy. We'll see.  
  
On Saturday Dave and I worked went on a group road ride with about twenty people from a local cycling team. I was a bit apprehensive about the ride since I'd be showing up on a relatively heavy cross bike with mid-level components and mountain bike pedals. Presentation and image are very important to the team and I didn't want to offend anyone with my inferior equipment. My anxiety was heightened after staying up way too late and drinking beer. The past couple of months I have all but abandoned beer in my daily life, so when I do drink the effect is much more pronounced. Friday night after helping one of Ryan's friends equip herself with a wonderful new bicycle, we decided to go out for pizza. It was a marvelously good time as I both like pizza and enjoy seeing/helping people find bicycles that suit their lives. However, by the time I got home and got to sleep I had only four solid hours of sleep to look forward to. I woke up foggy headed, forced myself to eat a few miscellaneous items that were still available in the cupboards and left. I arrived at the shop early and witnessed a lot of pre-ride photo-taking.  
  
The ride started very slow and everyone seemed quite pleasant to be around. There were introductions and brief conversations. The original plan involved Dave and I riding for an hour, turning around and then riding back to the shop together so that we'd be there in time for it to open. We stopped around an hour and the leader hatched a plan to keep us with the ride longer. I was fine with it as the morning was overcast and I knew that Chaes and the A-train could handle it for an hour or so. I was also starting to feel better and have fun. As the ride continued I stayed near the front of the "A group". I had felt insulted and self conscious going into the ride after a couple of comments made in the week prior to the ride. They were probably completely harmless, but when coupled with my inferior bicycle and non-fast-dude appearance I felt like I had something to prove. The pace ratcheted up a few notches and I took the opportunity to hit it hard on a couple of hills. In spite of tired legs from running, poor nutrition and not getting enough sleep I was going well. The rest of the ride was a nice balance of fun and challenge. I was never working particularly hard but I also wasn't soft pedaling. The people I rode with were mostly very nice and well trained at riding in a group. Overall it was a very positive experience.  
  
I'm still working on my *list* of changes that I'm going to invoke starting in June. Since my old blog has been archived I will post them again with a couple of additions:  
  
- **No more television. ** 
- **No more dining out while at work. ** 
- **Purchase nothing from the bike shop**. I have decided to add a clause to this one: in the case of an emergency I can purchase something from our shop, but only at *retail* pricing. I will not take advantage of my shop discount. This will allow me to deal with unexpected emergencies, but will ensure that the thing is actually an emergency and not just a convoluted twisting of reality. 
- **Buy clothing. **I haven't purchased clothing in years because I've been too busy wasting my money on other things. I typically shop at thrift stores so it's not a matter of expense, but simply taking the time to do it. Resolution: take that time. 
- **Listen to records*. ***It's been a few years since I last had a record player, but I was reminded the other day that it's something that I really like and would like to have again. 
- **Enter a running event.* ***I haven't decided exactly what type of event yet, but I want to enter at least one running event before it snows.  
  
More to come.
