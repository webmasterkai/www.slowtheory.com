We're getting a new camera. Beth's camera broke a while back. I have been trying to use it anyway, but the shutter only works intermittently. At least eighty percent of photos end up looking dark and grainy. I am excited. I have really enjoyed taking pictures lately.

Then, I fixed the computer. I had to format the drive. Since I was fucking things up anyway, I installed snow leopard. It seems about the same.

I left the house only twice. The first time I went to explore a route to Costco. It was terrible. I could get within a half mile quite easily, but then I entered a realm of moving-anchored-death. Machinery. Lights. Cars spinning out of control, driving over medians. A certifiable frenzy. It was bad. I will not be joining Costco.

The second time I went to the grocery store and the liquor store. It was a much nicer trip. At home I drank a lot of coffee, installed childproof latches on the desk drawers, drank beer, stared mindlessly at the television (we only get two channels, so it was merely practice. this is how I look at the television), ate dinner, and went to bed late. It was a good day.
