The first movements were awkward. I looked down at the rear tire to see if it was going flat. Nope. I decided that the unwieldiness of my body, pried from clutching itself, was being transmitted into the machine and consequently feigning the unpredictable and uncooperative nature of the body. So I pedaled, moments removed from watching the sun inch its way above the tree, which dramatically illuminated the landscape of a perfect day. My senses were lost in wonderment. I pedaled. I found myself next to good friend Justin and his friend Jerry. We three singlespeeders, feeling a certain prim intimacy with the terrain that cannot be claimed by the geared folks. I had no ambitions to do anything other than ride the course and appreciate the beauty. My focus has shifted. I no longer care about speeding through these things in a messy, chaotic, heart thumping at the backs of my eyeballs manner (at least not until next year when I will inevitably be drawn into the same trap).  
  
The colors were splendid. I was in awe of the *saturation*. It was as if some hipster opened iPhoto and dragged the slider all of the way to the right. Whoa. Dramatic, bro. I shook it off. No way, this is real. The early miles slipped away, I took off my jacket, put away my cycling cap, and settled into the day. We rode easy. I was geared 39x17. Although it felt too small early, I figured it would be perfect later. This turned turned out to be false. It was too small for the duration, but that's okay. I could just pedal quickly.  
  
The first ATV trail section pulled me out of my contemplative state. The ground was soft, and when it was not soft, it was very abruptly hard. The combination made for a slightly treacherous situation, and I was glad that I was riding casually. Racing through that section must have been crazy, with the more gifted riders seizing their opportunity to gain time on the fitter, but less talented riders. At least that's how it plays out in my mind. Since we were well back of the front group, I will not know until google reader kindly disseminates that information.  
  
For the first forty miles I felt great. After the second trail section, I felt a twinge in my knee that suggested my IT band was going to do its terrible thing again. I remained nervous until I reached the fifty mile checkpoint without incident. We sat at a picnic bench and I ate the shitty kinds of food that I would not eat in real life. Leaving the checkpoint, we were immediately assaulted by miles and miles of washboard gravel. By mile seventy the thing happened to me that always happens around mile seventy: I start to feel significantly better. It was not that I was feeling bad on this ride, but I suddenly felt great. For the rest of the ride everything was perfect. Even the half mile at 8% Pleasant View climb near the finish was no problem.  
  
Anyway, it was an awesome day. I wish that I had taken some photos, but I didn't. I was too wrapped up in  *being there.*
