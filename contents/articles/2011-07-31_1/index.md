It's been an exciting week. Thursday was [canoescapade][1], a journey from Lake Calhoun to downtown Saint Paul via Calhoun, Lake of the Isles, and the Mississippi. The canoe in which Michelle is partial owner was already full, so I opted to borrow a packraft. It didn't work very well, but it was still a lot of fun. The four mile portage from Cedar Lake to the Mississippi was awesome. I carried the canoe for a large portion of the downtown section. It was delightful. I love doing things that are ostensibly foolish and confounding, but totally awesome when observed properly. The other highlight was passing through one of the locks on the Mississippi. Super rad.

In the evening we went to a Project Runway party. One of our friends is on the show this season. Strange strange strange.  
  
Saturday I did the Dirty Lemming 104 mile gravel grinder with Doug. Due to unexpected stops we ended up starting 30 minutes behind the rest of the riders. I didn't think our chances of catching anyone was particularly high. We rode hard for about two hours. I rounded a corner at 35 miles and there they were. Doug was about five minutes back, but he would catch us at the 50 mile resting point. It wasn't *really* a race, but I kind of wanted to win anyway. I rode much of the rest of the course alone, waiting for the group at mile seventy and then again at mile ninety-three. At this point the organizer announced that it was the race portion of the event. This entailed an eleven mile drag race from Winsted to Watertown. I was riding my singlespeed so I knew that I needed to get some time before the last couple miles. I led out of town, slowly upping the pace until I didn't hear the crunch of gravel behind me. I rode at least a mile before I looked back to see how much time I had. In the distance I could see a handful of riders clustered together. I knew that they'd be working together to try to catch me. I just put my head down and kept pedaling. That was beauty of the singlespeed. Just pedal. I rolled into Watertown with about a two or three minute advantage. I won! Kind of...I guess another rider had taken off from the beginning and not waited at any of the stops. Oh well.
