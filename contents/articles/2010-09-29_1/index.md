I slept particularly well for most of last night. however, I woke up an hour earlier than I was willing to accept and went back to sleep. that's when the nightmares started. intense images that I thought I had forgotten assaulted and overwhelmed my brain. I woke up grateful that I could return to the more tempered reality that I have built for myself, but terrified of my brain's secret retention and ability to conjure/capture/project sensation. dreaming. nightmaring. it's not so bad. even given the disproportionate passing of time in dreamspace, it goes quite quickly and I am often aware that I am dreaming. there is an alternative. returning to my waking life is as simple as over-involving myself in the dream, mixing the delirium of freeform thought with the infiltrating sense of control that accompanies life(live)-action. but one day I will die. there will be energy that must leave my brain. I do not believe in *god* or orchestrated *afterlife*, at least not in the palpable sense. I have spent the majority of my life quietly, privately vacillating between agnosticism and atheism. however, this *supernova* of energy, this dream/nightmare/examination of everything and nothing: I might believe in this. I might believe that this final, thorough implosion of my human brain could become so temporally displaced as to seem like eternity. on mornings like this, that thought paralyzes me with fear.
