I've had the past couple days to get my things together for Almanzo. This has led to a certain amount of *overthinking* which has led to some bonus pre-race excitement, including a tubeless disaster and a panic trip to the bike shop. However, aside from wiping Stan's off of everything in my livingroom, I feel prepared.  
  
Efficiency. That's the goal. Aside from losing a bunch of weight, I've tried to formulate a strategy focused on relentless forward motion. I intend to skip Preston and just keep riding. I did this in 2010, but I didn't have enough water, so I paid the price. This year I'll pay the ~4lb penalty of carrying an extra hydration bladder in my frame bag. The first pack should last me until the State Park, where I should be able to make a quick switch to the second. I'm confident about everything, except for the start. I expect that it will be sketchy and aggressive, so I will have to ride like a tiger. If I can survive, I feel good about the rest.
