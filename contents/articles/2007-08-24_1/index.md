The state fair started yesterday. I waited to go to sleep, dulling my mind to the din of pop country and its zombie hordes. From a nearby apartment a counter-thump, counter-shouts, an alternate dimension of fervour threatened to disassociate the two realities. I sat in the reading chair and eased through my book one short chapter at a time, pausing only occasionally to take in the sexuality of the neon air. In the afternoon the thick, moist grayness gave way to a tremulous blue. I wandered hesitantly, testing the puddles for characteristics that might help to narrow the plane of my experience. Am I dreaming? Has it all ended at this? The pillow that I haven't slept on in three days is still damp. My mind wrests restlessly of, at, and from the new thing, lifting me up into an aching reunion of memory, sense and dilapidation. In the end I become prostrate and singular, and she no more than the phantom of smoke, the long lingering hint of ashes and the dull glow of embers. It is my own hand that I clasp as a kind of tribute, intent on its waxen, undulating surface. And yet the autumnal features, the sexual longing, the infested weary eyed thoughts, the aroma of crowds thick with interrogative anxiety waft through the air of this morning after like improperly laid regrets at the circumstances rather than the deed. I feel a little pang, but for the time my thoughts once again become bulleted and practical.
