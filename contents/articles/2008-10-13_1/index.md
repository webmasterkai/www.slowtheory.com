We left the bike shop at 6:15pm. The plan was to set up camp at Willow River just north and east of Hudson. The route that I put together was about thirty miles and I expected that we'd make it to the park around 8pm. This was based on some faulty math, rounding errors and ambitious expectations of our pace. Saturday night traffic along 10/Minnehaha was unpleasant and I almost immediately regretted designing the shortest-possible route. The chance for precipitation was 20% according to the weather channel. Based on my camping experience so far this year, I assumed that that chance was more like 97%, so it wasn't much of a surprise to me when we started to see lightning around Lake Elmo. I took a survey to see if anyone wanted to call it an early night and camp at Lake Elmo. With the exception of Alex who clearly wanted to ride recklessly into the heart of the storm, everyone seemed to be in the same boat of not wanting to not want to continue, therefore we continued. It's the sort of indecisive logic that can lead to messy situations. The lightning intensified. In hindsight some of the strikes were amazing and gorgeous, but at the time they were making me extremely nervous. As the lightning and thunder grew closer together, I was surprised to find that it was hardly even sprinkling. We must have ridden for fifteen or twenty minutes in the electrical storm with only an occasional drop of rain. For miles I scanned the ditches for a place to stop and take shelter. At the t-bone end of 10 we found our refuge at a church. Just as we were unloading our bikes the rain picked up. In the relative comfort of the church drive up window we decided to make dinner and let the storm pass through. It was a pleasant experience and I'm glad that we stopped. We must have spent an hour there, reveling in the giddiness of carbohydrates and nature's exotic light-show.

Eventually the storm let up and we continued. I'd never crossed 94 from the Minnesota side, so we suffered another delay when my haphazard route got us lost looking for the pedestrian crossing. Once we were in Wisconsin things were looking good until I got my second flat in a weekÂ­--different bike, different tire, different state. The only bike that I haven't had a flat tire on in the past thirty days is the pugsley, and I've only ridden that about ten miles. Aside from discovering that I didn't know how to use my pump and then not being able to find the cause of the flat, it was a relatively painless experience. 

We made it to willow river just after 10pm, picked a site from a pegboard and descended into the campground. It was foggy. All around there were vague outlines of camper-vans-RVS-Trailer-pullers. We pulled into our campsite and began setting up camp. Everything was wet. It would stay this way for the duration of our visit. Even though it was seventy degrees there was so much moisture in the air that my breath looked like smoke. In the morning it took four matches for me to get one that would light. The air was just thick, yet somehow I slept better than I would have if I'd been at home. When I woke up I immediately began making breakfast and packing up my things. I planned to be back by noon so that I could have lunch with my family to celebrate my sister's birthday. I knew that I could ride faster and smarter, but the knobby tires on the karate monkey would still make for a slow ride home. Dave and I left around 9am while Alex and Curt stayed behind. We climbed out of the campground and the temperature rose about ten degrees. I kicked myself for wearing a winter wool baselayer. Unfortunately I had used my cycling jersey from the day before as a makeshift towel to dry off my cookware. Some combination of things resulted in a stomach ache and/or cramp. It could have been the weather combined with being horribly overdressed or it could have been something that I ate (coffee?), but from about five minutes into the ride until an hour after I got home I felt pretty miserable. The ride itself was much more enjoyable. Dave knew of a better option for getting through the eastern suburbs, and after that we just picked our way through vaguely familiar sidestreets. It ended up being a longer route for me, but less frightening. 

I opted to take the karate monkey with a BOB trailer. Compared to the big dummy it was: slower, easier to change flats, easier to pack, and much more comfortable. I attribute the comfort to the handlebars. As much as I like On One Mary bars, they are a one hand position that is still somewhat unnatural. The drop handlebars on the karate monkey were absolutely comfortable. I was about two miles per hour slower than longer trips that I've taken on the big dummy. Riding in a larger group probably slowed things down a bit, as did riding a bunch of miles in the city, but I think overall it was still a slower setup. If I ride it to red wing later this week I think I may switch to a more road friendly tire.
