The power keeps going out. It's only out for a few seconds at a time, but it changes things. My perception, for instance, of distances, spaces and relationships between objects. Darkness. There is a candle burning on my other desk, unaffected by the maddening, gray stupor bred by the weather and shown in my disposition. Dispossessed. And hardly have I scraped together an intelligible sentence, hardly have I absorbed ideas rather than accumulations of words. Suddenly like reading the phone book, marveling at a repetition whose pattern is indistinguishable. Purely entropic. Tropic. Topical. Lexical. One idea leads to another and I have dreams that I remember briefly and fail to record. The answers, certainly, were found and then abandoned. Covering my body with a film of dried sweat. When I nap in the afternoon I sleep with a perpetual headache. The dull ache of inactivity. Mustering will. Fragmented. I am holding up? Asking questions? Sorting missed connections into people and ideas? Today it is raining. The lamentable sky blankets my tiny world and makes it all so boring and foul. I study the radar for redemption and there is none. (Fuck it.) My habits are generally unchanged. I report this impartially. I find certain flavors intolerable in the morning but quite pleasant by evening. 

I found out earlier today that when the power goes out the dryer resets its timer. I ended up paying $3.00 to dry one load of laundry. After I finished my laundry I went for a ride on the crosscheck. It was wet and there was no one around. After being too cold for a long time I spent the last hour bathing in my own sweat. It was a slog, motivated only by competition. She's ahead. I'm over fifty miles behind. It's going to take something special. Real things are overrated. 

Tornado sirens have gone off twice today. It's not wednesday and it's not the beginning of the month, so I can only assume that severe weather is nearby. Outside it's eerily calm. The trees are completely still and the sky is a dull shade of yellowish gray.
