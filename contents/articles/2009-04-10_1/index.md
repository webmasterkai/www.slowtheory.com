I finally got out on my new Alpacka raft today. It's been sitting in my bedroom for at least two weeks just waiting for an opportunity to hit the water. The general made a trip home from school just for the occasion. Since it was a light but somewhat cumbersome load I opted to hook the BOB up to my new single eight speed. I didn't do a very efficient job stowing everything, but it didn't matter since our destination was no more than ten miles from the apartment, probably less. I didn't realize that we'd picked a lake that doesn't allow boating. Fortunately, no one protested. Aside from a few curious glances from dogwalkers, we were unburdened by human interaction.

It took a while to unpack everything, inflate my boat, and ready myself for the water. I had no idea what to expect so I brought an extra, unneeded sweater and failed to bring extra socks. The water was cold. In fact, part of the lake was still covered in ice. We got in without issue. It was a bit awkward at first. I spun in circles or generally made little progress. "Hey, which way do I stick this thing in the water?" We paddled to the south end of the lake. I assumed that it would be the better way to go since the wind was out of the north. Once we reached a sheet of ice at that end of the lake we turned around.

Going the other direction was much easier. I think it was partially because there was a current pushing us that way but also because we'd figured out how to efficiently paddle a somewhat awkward vessel. In reality, we were probably still crawling, but it was fun and it's not really about speed anyway. We disembarked and took a break before paddling up the canal towards Sucker Lake and back. In total we probably spent two hours on the water, maybe a little bit more. It was fun. There are a few things that I need to change for next time: more rope (for roping my camera to the boat...it's waterproof, but it sure doesn't float), better packing both in and out, and extra socks(!!).
