The easy first pounds have been shed, and I've now made the transition into *slow and steady*. I'm down thrirteen pounds in eighteen days. This is good. It's been almost exclusively the result of cleaning up my diet. The further consequence has been a generally *good* physical sensation. I had gotten quite sloppy and often felt lethargic due to insufficiently healthy eating habits. Still a dozen or so pounds to get to 160, but I'm past the half-way point. I should easily be at my goal weight by the Get Lucky half marathon (March 17th). Then it will just be a matter of behaving myself.  
  
Last weekend my most problematic wisdom tooth became infected. For two days I was curled in a shameless ball of self pity. I already had a planned extraction in mid-April, but it became obvious that the date would have to be pushed forward. I'm now looking to have them ripped out of my face at the end of February. I'm not excited about the prospect, but hopefully all goes well and I'm back on my feet in a matter of days.
