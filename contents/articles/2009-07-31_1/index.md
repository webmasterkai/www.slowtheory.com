A week ago I sold my big dummy. mistake. so back up. last fall I dabbled with electric assist on the dummy. it was late in the year so I didn't ride a significant number of miles before putting it away for the destructive winter. initially I was thrilled to put it back on my bike this spring, so much so that I even upgraded to a more powerful system. however, my enthusiasm quickly faded. my miles rapidly declined, and over the four months that I had it on my bike I rode less than three hundred miles, reserving it only for situations where any other bike simply did not make sense. I finally admitted to myself that I didn't like it. why?

- irresponsible use on multi-use trails. hybrids recklessly flying down the trail at 20mph softpedaling  with the throttle bent to the bar. not safe. not cool. I don't think motorized vehicles should be on multi-use paths.
- heavy. even with one of the lightest systems on the market my bike was incredibly cumbersome to  move. this was amplified by the fact that I recently moved to a place without a garage.  limited range. many trips simply were not an option because the distance was outside of the  reasonable range of the battery pack.
- poor handling. prior to the motor my big dummy was rock solid. I could remove my hands from the  bars even with a large load on the back. after the motor it wanted to slip into a death shimmy. I don't  quite understand the physics of it, but the same phenomena has been reported from other cargo  bike/electric assist users.
- cost prohibitive. I didn't want to lock it up anywhere. ever. this problem was also amplified by moving  to a part of town where thieves are more inclined to accurately assess the value of a bike.
- robbed the fun from the cargo bike experience. it went too fast for no good reason. one of the best  parts about using a bicycle is that you can slow down, breathe deeply and enjoy the world around  you. I stopped looking at things as anything other than evidence that I was being propelled forward. I  was like a car driver.

so all of this resulted in selling the motor and the big dummy when I should have only sold the motor. oops. so after being without a longtail for a week for the first time in years I decided to add a bolt on xtracycle kit to my bianchi.

first impression was very good. the bike with the bolt on kit weighed in at a svelte 37.5 pounds, over twenty pounds lighter than my big dummy setup (lighter even than my big dummy without a motor). handling was decent. it flexes a bit while out of the saddle, but that is to be expected from the bolt on kit. and it was cheap. relatively so, anyway. I don't feel like I'm going to puke when I lock it up at the grocery store. but most importantly. the fundamental experience is the one that I remember. the one that I love. riding an electric assist is like riding with slightly muted senses. sitting in the backseat of an automobile and hanging your head out the window in order to feel like you are in sync with the things around you. but you're not.
