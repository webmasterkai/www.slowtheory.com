My brain is working slowly today. Going for a run. The soundtrack:

- X - When our love passed out on the couch
- The Dillinger Escape Plan - When good dogs do bad things
- Rites of Spring - In Silence - Words Away
- Ramones - Surfin Bird
- Public Enemy - Prophets of Rage
- Motorhead - The chase is better than the catch
- Modest Mouse - Shit Luck
- Minutemen - Please don't be gentle with me
- Meshuggah - Suffer in truth
- Meat Puppets - Oh, Me
- Judas Priest - A touch of evil
- Husker Du - Sunshine superman
- Guns N Roses - Think about you
- Fugazi - Instrument
- DJ Shadow - Organ donor
- Big Black - Kitty empire
- Beastie Boys - looking down the barrel of a gun
- Anti-Flag - Angry, young and poor

that's all.
