dave, chaes and the atrain drove to our house for mountain biking. it was a very nice morning. chilly and a little it windy, but nice once we made the ride to the trailhead. we did part of the south loop with mixed success and then headed to the much better maintained north loop. it was well packed and rolling very fast.

it was a fun trip. on the way home we took an ill advised route along the railroad tracks. there was quite a bit of walking. nonetheless, everyone seemed to enjoy themselves. we finished off with a round of pizza luce and football on the television.
