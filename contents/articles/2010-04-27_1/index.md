I have been debating what tire to use for Almanzo. Prior to yesterday I was leaning towards the large volume 700x42 specialized borough tire. However, I think I'm going to try something radical and use a Hutchinson tubeless cyclocross tire, either the piranha or the bulldog. I picked up a second set of wheels for the 3x and it happens to be designed for use with tubeless. I have tried to kludge together a cyclocross tubeless setup before, but that was using an ill suited tire and rims that were not designed for tubeless. With some stan's sealant this setup should be light, fast rolling, comfortable and nearly impervious to flats. I'm probably overthinking this since it's just a cyclo-touring-quasi-race in which I will finish poorly, but sometimes a person just needs to obsess over something insignificant. It's good life practice.
