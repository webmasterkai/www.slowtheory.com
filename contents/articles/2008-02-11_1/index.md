It was somewhat fortunate timing that I happened to read Turgenev's Fathers and Sons immediately prior to Dostoevsky's Demons. Most notably, Dostoevsky parodies Turgenev in his character Karmazinov, making numerous allusions to nihilism and Turgenev's Bazarov. The translation of my version of Demons includes this note: 

> 1. Among Dostoevsky's preliminary notes for Crime and Punishment we read: "N.B.: Nihilism is lackeyisness of thought. A nihilist is a lackey of thought." The term "nihilism," first used philosophically in German (nihilismus) to signify annihilation, a reduction to nothing (attributed to Buddha), or the rejection of religious beliefs and moral principals, came via the French nihilisme to Russian, where it acquired a political meaning, referring to the doctrine of the younger generation of socialists of the 1860s, who advocated the destruction of the existing social order without specifying what should replace it. the great nineteenth-century Russian lexicographer Vladimir Ivanovich Dahl (1801-1872), normally a model of restraint, defines "nihilism" in his Interpretive Dictionary of the Living Russian Language as "an ugly and immoral doctrine which rejects everything that cannot be palpated." The term became current after it appeared in Turgenov's Fathers and Sons (1862), where it applied to the hero Bazarov. (720) 

The character Stepan Trofimovich comments later of Bazarov: 

> I don't understand Turgenev. His Bazarov is some sort of false character, who doesn't exist at all; they were the first to reject him as having no resemblance to anything. This Bazarov is some vague mixture of Nozdryov and Byron, c'est le mot. (215) 

I mention these two things more in response to my reading of Fathers and Sons than its context in Demons. Indeed, it illuminated precisely the problem that I had in my reading: Bazarov himself was absolutely nothing. He was flattened and reduced by his nihilism to a character that represented nothing at all. However dull and boring, he was possibly an accurate projection of a man produced by the idea. But to what purpose? The Slavophils were no more interesting than Bazarov. Perhaps it was as suggested, that the reader is only to look on the author observing these things, thinking primarily and always of the author. The perpetual egoist. In any case, it was of some amusement that I was better able to think of Turgenev's work through the light offered by his most bitter adversary. Perhaps I will continue this thread of thought in the future.

I waited most of the day in hopes that the temperature might get closer to zero degrees. When I left for my run it was -5 with a -28 windchill. I dressed light in hopes of staying dry. For the most part it was spot on with the exception of my head, on which I wore only a lightweight smartwool balaclava. The first mile and a half wasn't bad as the wind was either blocked or at my back. I was feeling good. I turned to the west, and found that the wind was much harsher than I expected. It wasn't that it was continuously harsh, but the intermittent gusts were very strong and felt much colder than the reported windchill, which I imagine was based on the average wind speed. My beard froze to my balaclava so I took shelter briefly in the horse area at the state fairgrounds, untangling the twisted, frozen mess of hair, mucous and wool. I didn't want the dreaded chill to set in, so I got moving quickly. I changed directions and again felt comfortable until I reached the final stretch down Gortner. It's near the U of M campus and cuts through the agriculture fields. It is completely without shelter and I faced the full force of the wind. It cut easily cut through my layers. I put my head down and muttered. It didn't last very long, but it was truly terrifying. I got home and took a warm shower, vowing never to leave the apartment again.
