Several years ago I took my first trip to QBP's annual Frostbike event. I was in awe. There were interesting things everywhere and I hadn't even left the building before pre-spending my next several paychecks. That was a more carefree time in my life. Now I nod contemplatively, make notes on items/innovations that might be relevant to our customers, and chat with seldom seen acquaintances from the cycling world. It is also a time when I am generally successful at luring coworkers into riding their bikes with me. On this occasion the plan was hatched that I would ride to Saint Paul, meet Dave, and then ride to Bloomington where we would hook up with Bryce and Doug. The weather forecast was this: brilliant, in an almost unsettling way. The day started early. I left for Dave's at 6:30am. It was still dark and there was no traffic. It was perfectly serene until my first flat. Okay. Whatever. That sort of thing happens. I changed it, disconcerted that in spite of ten minutes of combing the tire, I was unable to find the source (even after locating the puncture in the tube). Sigh. I focused my psychic energy on the conservation of this thin strip of rubber. *Do not flat...do not flat...* I was now running late and had to ride up Summit much more quickly than I would have preferred. I made it to Dave's on time, but my rear tire had gone from blow-off-the-rim-2x25g-co2 firm to mister-wiggles-scary-in-the-corners squishy. I denied the reality of the situation, used Dave's floor pump to inflate it beyond 15psi, and we were off. It did not take long for reality to overcome my well intended delusion. I had another flat. We stopped to change it. The puncture in the tube was in the same location, so obviously I had missed *something*. I stared. I twisted my face and furrowed my brow. I felt. I dug. I asked Dave to do the same thing. We stood there for fifteen minutes trying to rationalize our shared inability to find the seemingly very obvious bit of debris that was lodged in my inappropriate-for-road-use-cx-tires. Nothing. I re-mounted the tire, inflated it, and we forged forward. "What are you going to do if you keep flatting?" "Walk." Once we reached Fort Snelling I had warmed up and convinced myself that I might actually be able to make the trip without flatting again. A mysterious force must have removed the bit of debris. That's, of course, the only reasonable explanation. Riding through Fort Snelling was picturesque. The deer were out in numbers, the morning sun was casting dramatic shadows, and a slight mist in the air made the day feel fresh and invigorating. I was happy to be riding my bike. The rest of the ride went well. We carefully measured our pace and arrived with just minutes to spare before Dave's morning class on electronic Campagnolo bits. I spent my time wandering.

45north was showing off a studded Husker Du. I would have been especially excited for this tire in previous years, but this year we didn't have winter and my fat bike has been nothing more than an infrequently used novelty.

Salsa showed a lot of employee bikes, configured as they ride them. It was really interesting and inspiring to see the passion behind the company.

SRAM showed off its new for 2012 Red lineup.

All City had interesting new bikes with \*gasp\* derailleur hangers.

And finally, Civia showed its new direction. This is probably the most promising news for us. Although we are not currently a Civia dealer, the new direction of increased accessibility for urban customers could potentially mesh very well with our shop. Rather than pricing themselves out of the market with admittedly cool high end town bikes, they've focused on bikes that average people might find both practical and affordable. The only notable flaw with the new bike was the lack of fork crown clearance. The fork will change before it is officially released, but I am still skeptical of its ability to fit a studded tire and fender. Definitely worth a follow up look though.

When Dave finished with his class we ate lunch and then met up with Bryce and Doug, both of whom were obviously enjoying the balmy weather and abundant sunshine. It was a spirited return trip full of good riding and conversation. We stopped briefly at Fort Snelling to bask in the sunshine and enjoy a snack. Overall, it was a lovely day and a fantastic weekend. Thanks dudes!
