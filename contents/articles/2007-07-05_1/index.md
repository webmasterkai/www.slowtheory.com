In the evening I decided to go for a bike ride. I haven't been able to log as many running miles as I would like, so I've been trying to ride more for cardio. I maintained a relatively leisurely pace until I reached the river road. I saw a recumbent in front of me with a full fairing. The bike intrigued me so I upped the pace to catch up to him. As I got closer he kept glancing at his rear view mirror and increasing his pace. I got within a hundred feet of him and remained at a safe distance behind him since we were already doing 25mph. When we got to a hill I figured it was a good chance to pull alongside him, compliment his awesomeness and check out his bike. I pulled up, said hello. He gave me a quick and decisive glare, said nothing. At this point I realized that I would have to stay in front of him. My ego wouldn't let an unfriendly bicyclist beat me. As a result I finished the twenty-five miles at an average speed of 19.6mph. It's the fastest ride I've recorded since last summer when I got my garmin. I feel good about my fitness right now. I'm hoping that soon I will find the right combination of shoes and timing to log more miles running, but until then I'll keep working at improving cardiovascular fitness and ability to endure pain.
