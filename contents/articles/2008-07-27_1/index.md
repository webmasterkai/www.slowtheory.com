It's been a while since we've done a long road ride. Mostly I've been mountain biking, camping, taking shorter rides, and extending my daily commute. The mileage total has ended up about the same, but I still felt compelled to get in a long ride this month. Jeff and I set out fairly early. The sky was covered in a dim, gray haze and the air felt extraordinarily thick. I suddenly wasn't very excited about the prospect of over six hours outside. This coupled with my lack of a genuine road bike at the moment made me a bit apprehensive about the amount of effort that would be required to finish our proposed course. I didn't deliberately make it difficult, but there were continuous rolling hills and a few very steep hills towards the middle of the ride. 

After dropping in and out of Marine on Saint Croix we continued south towards stillwater. The road turned down and I started to feel better. Somehow I managed to map the steepest and hilliest route through town. We turned on to a lesser known side street that immediately launched upwards at grades in excess of 18%. It was short, but followed by another hill that had grades in the teens. We then went up and down several times before returning to the elevation where we'd started (if not a bit lower). This left a brutal climb out of town. I was starting to get really tired. It didn't help that the temperatures were high and the air so dense that we couldn't decide whether it was raining or moisture was simply appearing on our bodies as a consequence of the humidity. This theme continued until about mile 70. From here the next 7 or 8 miles were downhill. We reached the river road and had a rather uneventful backwards loop.
