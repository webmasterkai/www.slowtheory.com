tomorrow seventeen oh-k  
start again  
it's 5:28am. I'm lying- ­  
I'll tell you that this is a cup of coffee.  
on the side of the cup of coffee there are outlined droplets- ­  
glistening stains from which  
I have tongued salvation.  
poetically now- ­  
stuttering vibrations cursed upon my lips  
when I read semi-silently in convicted quavers  
final notices for opportunities  
to evaluate the terms of the mortgage that I do not have.  
oh god  
there is no return address.  
oh god  
it was prepaid at bulk postage rates.  
oh god. it's 6:19am. no, of course it's not.  
it's gloomy except for incinerated splashes of gibson  
and the hue of inspecting my morning after face.  
prideful vicious smirk­-  
or not saying a word to this heaped bundle of  
dress up.  
early this morning I saw this girl I've not invented  
wearing a scarf for the first time this autumn.  
She preened in the light of her good fortune  
to be markedly considered  
as wedded to the SIGNIFIED- ­ 
or she didn't notice that the clock read  
8:09am ­ 
-it's so easy to lie about the time when the sky  
is drowned out with clouds.
