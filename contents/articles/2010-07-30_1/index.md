I will admit, that was one of the strangest nights of my life. *surreal.* I sat at the edge of this group which consisted of the playwright, his chin tilting actress, two distinct people from my past, and the *orchestrator. *while it was not strange that two people from my past were present, it was strange that they found each other in spite of me rather than because of me. she sat across the table pretending to her other friends that she'd never seen me before, that she was actually *flummoxed *by this childish assault on the playwright. of course, I meant no harm and had misjudged his character. okay. the second part is/was a lie. I had absorbed his character in a moment and could not resist the compulsion to prod when prodded. I had spent the night in shadowed obscurity when the *orchestrator *turned to me and asked, "So you're a writer also?" *of course not*. earlier in the evening the chin tilting actress had asked, "So you're a photographer also?" *of course not*. I could take no more of this compartmentalization and haphazardly conceived a parody that reached its crescendo with a magnanimous call to be expressive with the exhibition of *soul* at the dot of an *i.* having realized that I'd taken it too far I drew him into conversation, "*So what sort of thing are you?*" *well I am the playwright, of course*. I asked what I considered to be the obligatory questions and made a few failed attempts to inject flattery. they left, sending a text message moments later to the regulars that I was not to be invited again.  
  
the night continued. the second person from my past finally made eye contact and uttered words in my direction. the *orchestrator* identified this as two strangers suddenly noticing one another and making the kind of primitive connection that strangers make. he seemed pleased but oblivious. perhaps I was deceived. perhaps he was also feigning. four people locked in deception, or one centered on it. I left my heart in the sand, but contributed little else but words meant to deflect from my physical body. it was extremely late when I stumbled back to my apartment. I just sat there.
