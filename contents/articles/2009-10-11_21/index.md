I woke up early this morning. 5am. went to wirth to watch the sunrise. crisp, cool morning. it reminded me of autumn. three laps north of the tracks and one south. a wild turkey scurried across the trail in front of me. I looped back on it and it scurried the other direction. spiderwebs tingling on my skin. faster as I began to wake up. wool and knickers. time for my second breakfast. time to sip my coffee and wait for this thing to happen.
