I had no idea! of course, none whatsoever. in a final appeal of complete earnestness, I felt a deliberate sort of resignation­--further, an anticipation of invention by which the compulsion of the senses overcame that of vice. please, and she begged so nicely. and feeling nothing but meanness I grew to hate her, while at the same time I professed my deepest affections and proved them by destroying things in her name. it was expensive and she, exceptional in her grief. I narrated eloquently. 

why does this mannequin have nipples? why why why? why god? and the radio and the electricity of my brain. why here, with this gradual regeneration of a man! 

I thought about mentioning it in passing--­the challenge then being to orchestrate a passing of two things whose proximity has recently necessitated catastrophe. I spoke to the mannequin deliberately, locating my eyes somewhere between the bridge to the place once held by her severed head and the outrageous nipples. her clavicle. I loved it tenderly. speaking hastily I constructed a plan while she attempted to marginalize the growing symphony of noise confounding my brain. the ache! ­a dream of being sliced to the point of paroxysm! 

but how can this new object be of greater effect than the old? and if the old has become nothing except a conversational piece through which I might approach the topic of degradation, then oughtn't I just take the mannequin and make it my lover? she, my plastered savior! oh, how it all still means so much to me.
