dirty fucking night full of secrets  
  
vixen. harlot. whore. hero. magic.  
  
enshrined on your wall of mementos painted turquoise  
  
designated madness illness conscious and conscientious enough to be  
  
aware  
  
that my head my physical, removed head is a virtue  
  
in its figure. I trophy. rescinded love. malad*ise*. paladise. para... malaise.  
  
lacking in self confidence of course, I would not estimate it highly  
  
but it's been deemed worth acquisition tagged denoted filed assessed compared  
  
left to grow dust like disease  
  
illuminated in this dirty night  
  
flickering candlelight.
