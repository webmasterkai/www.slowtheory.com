While Michelle has spent her time doing much more important things, I have been planning our itinerary for the subsequent attempt at (almost) through hiking the Superior Hiking Trail. This ended up being much more difficult than I'd originally anticipated--mostly because of funky post office hours (Schroeder, for instance, is open from 8am-10am on Saturday) and infrequent camping on the northern end--but I feel pretty good about the plan we have in place. The first six days are an aggressive pace that allows us to reach the Schroeder post office before it closes at 10am on Saturday. Each food drop has around 9000 calories, which should allow us around 3000 calories per person, per day, and weighs in around 6 pounds. Our gear has been exhaustively reworked to be the light/minimal. For shelter, we'll be using a Cooke tarp, Cuban fiber ground cloth, and Mountain Hardware Phantom +32 bags. I'll do a more comprehensive post on gear sometime in the next week as we finalize our plans. So, world, sage advice says, "Let people know where you're going to be in case you disappear or get your head gnawed on by a wolf." This is where we'll be (still need to verify distances and add in more notes):
