last night I spilled oregano on the stove. even after cleaning this morning, it smelled like oregano when I boiled water for my coffee. I didn't *not *like it.  
  
this morning at 4:30 I woke up after sleeping for only a short time. I was slightly cold. I shifted around trying to make the blankets large enough to cover both my feet and my face. I'm 5'11". this would prove futile. it was pleasant and reminded me of the childish impulse to immerse further into the recesses of unconsciousness and soft textures. I decided to get up. I had no particular reason to get out of bed, but I wanted to capture this secret part of my night that hinted at its imminent transformation. it is still not quite obvious when the sun is out, but autumn is drawing near. the chill. the freshness. the crispness. I am thrilled. it is my favorite time of the year. all of the things that have remained perpetually soggy and devoid texture will become new and interesting. I made a cup of coffee and turned on some tom waits. fresh from dreaming my senses struggled to acclimate. my hands appeared foreign and I fumbled with the simple task of transferring the ground beans to my french press. the absence of psychological and physical noise made the stereo an impressive thing to behold. I was consumed in a way that volume and space could not simulate in the daytime, drowning in the bustle and chaos of *regular things*. I stayed up for a couple of hours, absorbed in my senses, and then went back to bed.  
  
I did not sleep particularly well or long. the cool breeze meant that my body would move about in search of another warm body. I twisted and thrashed. the blankets inevitably wound up unfashionably wrapped around my neck.  
  
when I woke up the second time I walked to the bank. I felt a weird energy with the teller. I walked home muttering to myself.
