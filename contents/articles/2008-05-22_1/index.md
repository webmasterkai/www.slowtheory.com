After last week's disastrous run I didn't have very high hopes for this week. I knew that at the very least I needed a 16 mile run that didn't end with me half dead in a ditch somewhere. Ryan was kind enough to return the favor of running support on his xtracycle, so I was confident that at least I wouldn't bonk out because of dehydration or lack of kcals. If I was going to bonk, it was going to be my legs. The first four miles were really difficult. I've been training only 1-2 times per week because of some nagging injuries, hoping that cycling will cover the balance. This lack of frequency has resulted in having to relearn my stride at the beginning of each run. So for about four miles my limbs flailed wildly and I sweat profusely, without a modicum of grace or efficiency. 

As I turned on to Summit I started to feel a little bit better. I saw the peace coffee guy on his Long Haul Trucker pulling a bikes at work trailer. I yelled out, "Hey! Is that a bikes at work trailer?!" He looked confused or irritated and said, "yeah." It probably didn't help that the last word or two squeaked out as I gasped for breath. Later on Summit I saw an old bearded guy with a blue xtracycle and a step through frame. It was fucking awesome and gave me some hope for old age. Summit ended too quickly. 

Como sucked. It was boring and I got honked at by turning traffic even though I had a walk signal and was in the clearly painted crosswalk area. It seemed almost endless, and just as I was approaching Lake Como I got stuck at a train crossing for about five minutes. I contemplated whether this was a.) a fortunate opportunity to catch my breath, or b.) catastrophic. My legs were stiff when I started running again, but I started feeling good again once I saw that I crossed the half marathon mark at 2:02:30. It's not my fastest time over that distance, but given my lack of training I was quite pleased with it. More importantly, my pace hadn't slowed since mile five. 

I continued along Como, taking a brief detour at the end to get nearer to seventeen miles and to prove that I could handle a hill in the final ten. It feels good to have gotten past the ten mile to go mark, especially given that the last twelve miles were done at essentially the same pace. I wasn't getting slower. It was just hurting more.
