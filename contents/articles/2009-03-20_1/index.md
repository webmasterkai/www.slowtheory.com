It was innocent enough: deer, beer, the interwebs. My friends were buying packrafts. An inflatable dingy for how much? Ridiculous! I was vaguely familiar with them from the trip that Eric Parsons took along the Alaskan coast with his Pugsley and a packraft. So my mind wandered. Ride up to where we camped last year and float back down the Saint Croix? Training along the Chain of Lakes and going under those neat bridge underpasses? Oh man, that sounds like fun. At some point I watched this video:While I don't intend to paddle down waterfalls, it encouraged the notion that even though the inflatable raft weighs less than 5 pounds and can easily be carried on a bicycle, it's also very durable.

Then something something something...I bought one.

The next morning the general and I went to REI to get paddles and a life jacket. I'm excited to nurture a new hobby. Perhaps paddling will become my new running.
