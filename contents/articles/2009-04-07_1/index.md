I have not written in some time. Last night I had a dream about a girl I was basically in love with from 3rd to 12th grade. I still dream of her sometimes. Reconstruct. What was it? We sat close to each other. I remember distinctly the texture of her skin. Of course, we were both adults now. My mind had aged her image just perfectly.

Sunday I napped for almost two hours in the afternoon and then proceeded to sleep through the night. I have been exhausted lately. Too slow to read. Too slow to write. But not too slow for dreaming. I save my faculties during the day. Dreary, dreamy eyed and casting ill formed shadows, my imagination lurks somewhere behind lost eyeballs, waiting for its chance to play while my body recovers from the unfamiliar stresses of being busy.

Commuting by bicycle has its advantages.

Last night on my way home I met up with a guy on a steamroller. I've seen him around before and finally took time to talk to him. It was a pleasant ride until we got to Stinson. There is a bike path on Stinson. We were in it. At an intersection we stopped. A car rolled up on the cross street and stopped. It was our turn. Obviously, our turn. My new friend was a couple of feet in front of me. Just as we were both in plain sight in front of her car she started to go. I swerved. My pannier tapped against the front of her car. She stopped. It seemed intentional. She accelerated when there were two bicycles directly in her line of sight. She stopped just after bumping me, then had the audacity to return my middle finger as she went on her way. I escaped unscathed, except my mind, which has once again been reminded that people will use their vehicles as unscathed, except my mind, which has once again been reminded that people will use their vehicles as weapons. That's the world we live in. Violent, sick.
