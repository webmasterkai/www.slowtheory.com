highlights:

- stopping for lemonade at dave's
- the chazz trouncing alex nelson in a pugsley hill climb
- passing fixie girl, looking around and seeing no one, stopping, being subsequently passed by her at which point she said, *your buddy's bike fell apart...*
- drinking honeybluemoon while putting together a rental bike for alex to ride on the big sunday extravaganza
