 We had a plan. Sort of. The plan started like this: do some gravel scouting around the area where the Westside Dirty Benjamin will be held in a couple weeks. Utilizing google satellite images I mapped out a route that took us down the LRT to chaska, to watertown via as much gravel as possible, and then back to the Twin Cities on the Luce Line. I knew that people traffic on the first section would be nearly unbearable, but I couldn't come up with a better plan so we went for it anyway.  
  
Even with the heavy people traffic we made exceptionally good time to Chaska, averaging over 18mph while being safe and not putting forth much effort. Including riding to the shop we were each around forty miles at that point and speculating on exactly how many miles we could put in for the day. Just outside of Chaska we finally found ourselves on gravel roads. After only a few hundred feet I knew that this would be a different kind of gravel riding. It was rough, soft, loose,Â  and very tricky to navigate (it's difficult to discern from the pictures, but trust me...it was tricky).

There were a few sections of pavement, but generally we were able to stick to gravel until we reached Watertown. We arrived there looking a bit haggard and beat up, which came as a surprise to me since the first forty miles had gone so well. The road conditions were so gnarly in places that Jeff neglected his hydration and arrived in Watertown with impressive salt lines outlining his bib shorts.  
  
The cue cards that I made using mapmyride worked wonderfully. We didn't get lost even though the route consisted of turning almost every mile for twenty miles.  
  
After a fiasco that involved checking if the coffee shop was open and then pursuing a non-existent BP gas station, we stopped at the grocery store where I downed two cans of soda and a couple donuts. When it's hot outside I have trouble eating. It just seems so unappealing so I stick to empty calories. It was our first extended break of the day. In spite of the slow travel on the rough roads we were still making good time. We hopped on the Luce Line and started towards home. We rolled up to my house with 106 miles and an average computer speed of 16.8mph. Considering the conditions, I was very pleased. Beyond that, I also had a lot of fun and was happy to share a "Sunday" ride with Jeff.
