it was a long day. we started early. jeff turned back early due to a nagging back injury. ryan stopped after being pummeled by an almost unrideable lrt. I made it eighty miles but eventually succumbed to boredom and lack of fortitude. the final twenty-four miles were without water. I thought about licking the ground a few times. oh well. it was fun anyway.
