I am drinking tea this morning instead of coffee. Accidentally. Without cognizance or premeditation. Suddenly the only alternative, slipping deeper and deeper. Drinking tea is a cathartic experience. Watch with each sip as I ooze to the surface, dissatisfied with the taste that's been left in my mind. It is saturday morning. That means bluegrass and laundry. Outside it is dreary (I am back to describing the weather). It is my least favorite day of the week. People enjoy saturday. They stare at each other while seamlessly blending pheromones and chemicals for their minds. There will be noise, and they will lose themselves to the mindless undercurrent of physical energy. Sex, violence. Cathartic in their own way. I don't like saturday. It is irregular. It is frightening. People seem to produce themselves out of nothingness, multiplying like the sudden appearance of illness in the body. "I have a quiet temperament."

and I am particulate matter. Floating. Drifting. Essentially being nothing, except that en masse we can erase the sun.

Minds should not coalesce with life. It is not reasonable. People die. What the fuck? Sadness. Meaninglessness. Disease. This undercurrent of primal energy that defies language and reason. What the fuck? Genuine illness is complacency, a generic acceptance that the parameters of regularity are determinate. Fuck that. Mingling beneath strobing neon lights, I can taste/smell/touch/feel real disease. That type that gets older and less curious. No longer fatigued by the insane motion of a dandelion pressed to the earth by the wind. I smile.

Dereliction. Of the soul? Collective unconsciousness? Old friends. It is awkward because the situation has been stripped of its energy. Passivity and disinterest. "How is this..." Insert quarters. Push forward. Pull backwards. Return to savior. Etc.

Without coffee I become less human. This terrifies me. It is genuine addiction. My language suffers. My temperament shifts. Externally manipulative chemicals. I want to wake up and be the same/different/everything.
