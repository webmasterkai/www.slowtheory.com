I haven't ridden my bike very much this year. Life has been busy. Consequently, running has become a more convenient, interesting, and efficient option. Perhaps I was feeling the swell of  the imaginary free-time that I have gained in the past week, or maybe it was only the natural ebb and flow of sentiment, but cycling made its dramatic reemergence over the weekend. 

Saturday morning I met Bryce, Brandon&Abby, Ken, and a few other people at the TCBC ride that leaves every Saturday morning from Dunn Brothers. In total, there were about twenty people. I didn't want to get the Mr. Pink dirty, so I chose to ride my Nature Boy with studded tires and a 35x16 gear. That would prove to be a rather questionable decision. While the ride certainly wasn't *fast* by summer standards, the combination of lacking bike fitness and mandatory cadence-induced-discomfort made it seem rather difficult. It didn't help matters that the majority of the riders were riding slick tires and multi-speed bikes.

We took a meandering path west, with the TCBC contingent doing the work and making the navigational choices. Riders packed together tightly. The first crash occurred around Lake Harriet and took down five or six people. I narrowly remained upright, reveling in the fortune of the perfect confluence of luck, choice, and circumstance. It was one of a handful of moments that evoked sincere appreciation for the tiny spikes littering my otherwise smooth-rolling tires.

I was starting to get tired and hungry by the time we stopped in Excelsior at mile forty. After our break, the *friends group* split off from the main ride and took the LRT back towards Hopkins. This was a nice stretch. The dangling, snow encrusted tree branches, reduced intensity, and improved conversational setting enlivened what had been a "slog" for many of us. 

When we were back in the city, we decided to go to Buster's for lunch. The original plan for the ride was to accumulate 100 miles of riding, interwoven between a series of increasingly compelling food and leisure breaks. We dropped our bikes off at Angry Catfish. Since Frostbike is in town, there was a multinational throng congregating outside of the shop. A few people took the opportunity to photograph the three All City bikes in the wild, while others commented on our foolishness for riding such nice bikes in such poor conditions.

After a Lagunitas cappuccino stout and a veggie burger, I was ready for more. We looped into Saint Paul, and then turned towards Ohio. I followed Bryce's seemingly torrid pace, reaching the top feeling like I was about to collapse. Later the data would tell me that we only averaged 9.4mph on the meaty part of the climb. Sigh. Subjectivity. After riding the back side of Ramsey, I was ready to go home. I finished the day at 80 miles.

On Sunday morning Bryce and I met to ride to Frostbike. The sudden return to distance riding on a singlespeed left me with a sore left knee, so I opted to take the Mr. Pink out into the slop. Shrug. It's a bike. The gears were nice, but the shifters worked only about 20% of the time due to the cold weather. Five swipes generally resulted in one shift. I'll have to do something about that. The temperatures were actually quite balmy for Minnesota, and it's a little bit disconcerting that $300 shifters were behaving as they were.

Frostbike was uneventful. After several years of going to the event, I have streamlined the process to look something like this: look at the three booths that are interesting, eat a big lunch, check out the scratch and dent (not applicable this year, as it was a *Saturday thing*), and spend at least ten minutes talking to an overly aggressive rep from a company whose product absolutely no one at the show finds relevant. After being snared exactly once, I remember that eye contact is not always appropriate or necessary.

The ride home was beautiful. I had briefly considered cutting it short by hopping on the light rail, but by the time the opportunity arose, I was happy to be alive, outdoors, and enjoying a ride with Bryce. By the end of the day I'd accumulated another 46 miles, for a two day total of 126 miles. Not bad. I think that's about 1/3rd of my riding for the *entire year*. Next week I intend to return primarily to running, but it was a fun distraction. I like to take a week off from heavy running mileage every 4-6 weeks, just to allow my body time to recover from any nagging injuries.
