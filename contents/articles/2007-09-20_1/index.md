my god. imagine my (fucking) surprise when I  
spied again,  
from not more than ten feet that fucking  
dirty pulled back ponytail. no (fucking) way.  
jesus.  
and we criss-crossed  
but imagine that he was not even (fucking) alone.  
I used to sort of like  
him. when he wasn't asking for money $$  
or (fucking)Â­--  
I liked the IDEA OF HIM anyway.  
because I could sink my teeth into it,  
and I thought for a moment  
he might be  
praying to the sweet corn.  

## part II

we each stood our ground, slanted dull monstrous glow. not inclined, or should I say too tired or indisposed, to feel anything towards the other but the widely impacted disaster of the other's life. never enemies nor friends. I trusted him only as much as I assured myself that he could be outsmarted, that his diseased body extended its tentacles into his mind. shuffling on one leg, dying on the other. ankle now clicking when I walk. we waited there with our similar monstrosities, the morning sun buried under a melting gray canvas. abandoned, yet sustained by infrequent acts of self compassion--the kind that emanates from the place that realizes death doesn't spare anyone, that our best opportunities were squandered. we could compare notes, find similar patterns, rare congruences, perhaps we might even feel symmetrical; but for each other we would feel only the same indifference and shame bestowed upon our own weary form. so standing, swaying, with fading contours, mostly forgotten or regrettable, we met in a godlike ode to the nature of salvation, being relieved from the emptiness of existence after its self immolation. the sky an ashen, earthy gray--residue of our distant, ill received dreams. 

I saw him and there was nothing that I could do. my motion was bound to overtake him, and having done so escaping notice would be impossible. what do I have to hide? I thought. nothing. I have grown stronger, not weaker. yes, yes, of course I am older now but that is to be expected. my conviction, my mind, and my body have all grown stronger. I toil endlessly for two reasons: to suffer and to become distorted by temporary strength (which becomes endless so long as the end is not visible). so I went by as though nothing were the matter. it was not until I was forced to use my voice that I realized the one thing that had grown much weaker: my voice. my voice is most powerful when it is least interested, scarcely audible. this is the way that it exists naturally and it is only when I try to elevate it to the level of conversation or inject it with false enthusiasm that I betray a weakness of character. there was, indeed, no mistake made in showing him what I have become. my mistake was in speaking.
