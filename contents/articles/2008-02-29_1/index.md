I am not yet thinking about that. I have taken to quoting, this time from The Sorrows of Young Werther: 

> Since I have been seeing all sorts of people day in and day out, and have observed how they carry on, I am more lenient with myself. It is true that we are so made that we compare everything with ourselves and ourselves with everything. Therefore, our fortune or misfortune depends on the objects and persons to which we compare ourselves; and for that reason nothing is more dangerous than solitude. Our imagination, by its nature inclined to exalt itself, and nourished by the fantastic imagery of poetry, creates a series of beings of which we are the lowest, so that everything else appears more wonderful, everyone else more perfect. And that is completely natural. We so frequently feel that we are lacking in many qualities which another person apparently possesses; and we then furnish such a person with everything we ourselves posses and with a certain idealistic complacency in addition. And in this fashion a Happy Being is finished to perfection--the creature of our imagination. (Goethe 78) 

It is true, as I was saying, that I am not yet thinking of it in such vulgar terms. I mention this not as a characteristic of my obsession, but rather as a declaration of its impermanence--a mere passing fancy or whim to which I owe nothing. Tomorrow--indeed, in but a few hours when the sun rises--there is a probability no more or less than today, or of the contrary that I will feel absolutely disinclined, lackluster in my regard for that thing which presently consists of all that it means for me to imagine. Already, I have forgotten (incompletely) its texture next to mine. Yes, yes. I confess not only to a great fickleness of heart, but of bestowing upon that thing incompatibilities with its constitution. This is why I feel not the slightest guilt for my sentiments this morning or apprehension at what I might feel the morning after this. (If only I could pray openly for another Tunguska)

I need to start extricating myself from the ridiculous situations in my life that localize negativity. How wound up I have become in other people's notions of inadequacy and spite! I have become an object of spite, yet I sit passively, dulled in an explanation that I have concocted purely to justify my lack of resistance, concluding that there exists some attribute in his nature that allows him this woeful freedom (along with attributes equal to mine that consequently nullify any strength I might have in relation). He bowls over with his impish confidence, even when it is apparent that he is lying and hateful, at times thinking it cleverly concealed (but how morbidly obvious it is, really). So I will covertly plan and scheme, project by various means both electronic and imaginary my removal. 

I sit back and think. 

The lights turned off and I was sitting in the bathtub in the dark. Somehow the lack of electricity made me think that I was at a risk of electrocution. I stumbled around, groping to find a candle a lighter. I read by candlelight until my eyes could no longer stand it.
