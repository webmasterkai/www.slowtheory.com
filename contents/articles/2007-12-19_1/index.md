The UPS driver took my package, placed it on his dolly, and promptly dropped in lengthwise to the floor in front of him, stammering his vague assurances that my packaging was able to sustain such a blow. This, I already knew as I had packed it to accommodate for the average UPS employee's willingness to fuck up their customer's shit. I forswore UPS not too terribly long ago after they deemed one of my bike boxes twice the length and three times the width of an actual bike box, thereby making it more of a gorilla crate than an actual box. Along with this declaration came a corresponding bill of over two hundred dollars. Despite my protests I could not convince them to believe that I hadn't shipped a gorilla. Fortunately, they granted me a favor and refunded the additional fee, with the implication that they'd be keeping their collective eye on me. 

That's how my day started. That, and a hangoverÂ­--earned not from massive alcohol consumption, but rather during the innocent act of consuming three beers. There have been occasions for drinking more or feeling worse, but never has there been more surprise on my contorted face as I've draped my body over the toilet gagging. I didn't vomit, but I certainly wasn't far away and might have felt better had I let loose. I didn't start feeling better until around noon.

I surveyed my situation. Something didn't make sense. I thought, how did I get here? Geographically there was no explanation. The ruse was over and I woke up. I will sometimes dream, realize I am dreaming, and rather than waking cause all kinds of carnage in my dream. A recent television program reminded me of this rarely utilized ability and perhaps inspired the idea in my head, therein begging the question of whether I was genuinely beyond the scope of my dream or if it was merely incidental to the dream plot.
