During april shop rides home as a group became a common thing. Dave and I have regularly ridden together, but with Alex first moving to Apple Valley and then staying with me, he has often been added to the mix. It's been a lot of fun. Three weeks ago or so Dave was on his road bike while I was on my singlespeed and Alex was on his heavy touring bike. He decided to playfully put in an attack. It was fun and has resulted in our rides becoming secret, awesome, fun spirited races. Last night it was just Alex and I, so it quickly became a team trial. This was aided by a late night decision made by Alex to put a 52x17 gear on his bike. The result--19.5mph average speed. For a commute, with panniers and traffic, that is really fast. I spent most of my time drafting Alex as he was riding like a motorcycle. Anyway, it was a nice end to the month. I trailed off a little bit in miles over the last two weeks, but it was still a pretty solid April.
