While confessing a natural tendency for vacillation of opinion, I must also express utter shock at the breadth of personal feeling and depth of investment that I have for *rain*. At times I simply loathe it, while at other times I find nothing more wonderful and life affirming. Good, bad, or indi(ffer)sc\[e]r[n\](t)ible, it imprints a distinct impression. Last year at Almanzo I spent about seven hours in the rain. It started slowly, gained momentum, and did not quit until longer after I said *no more!* My hand, forearms, and elbows were numb. Dirt was permanently embedded in the backs of my eyeballs. Like a pouting child, I assured myself that I would never ride a bike again. Ha ha! A lie, of course...and I knew it, but rain stripped me of my maturity and turned me into a ball of raw, childish emotion. I would have kicked it in the shin...had it been a thing with a fragile shin. Likewise, I recall riding back from Red Wing with a BOB trailer packed with camping gear. It started to rain forty miles from home. I was cold. It was October. Temperatures were in the thirties and I only had short finger cycling gloves. Stupid.  
  
This morning was the other kind of thing, the kind of thing that I love. Ostensibly, nothing was different. I was cold. There was nothing beautiful about the morning. My mind was not filled with extraordinary thought or emotional rapture. Yet, when I consider the distinct impression left by my ordinary commute, it is one of pure bliss at having experienced it. And that, friends, is why rain is weird. The end.
