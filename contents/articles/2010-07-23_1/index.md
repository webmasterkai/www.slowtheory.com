![1 month progress](http://f.slowtheory.com/4821440417_d18ff11d5a.jpg "1 month progress")  
  
one month ago I decided that I would start working more on my overall conditioning. up until that point I'd had a good year cycling, but had done very little running and weight lifting. over the past month I've tried to couple more diverse activity with improved eating habits. results have been mixed. I need to be more diligent about going to the grocery store. a few times I ran out of healthy food and picked up lunch near work. while I was able to find healthy food, it was not cost effective and I was not able to eat as frequently as I would have liked. for the next four weeks I want to continue to improve on that front while maintaining a good balance of cycling, weights and running. my time at the gym has provided a huge mental and emotional lift, both in terms of how I perceive myself and the chemical reactions occurring in my brain. oh. and I suppose I also want to improve my sweet farmer's tan.
