Well, that as interesting. Jeff and I decided to go on a fast and light camping trip from Friday night until today. Our *planmaking *was a bit haphazard and last minute, but we finally settled on a seemingly foolproof plan of riding up to Big D's cabin near Cornucopia, Wisconsin via a completely unknown route derived from google map's *bike there* feature. Good, right?  
  
Jeff arrived at the shop around 4pm but we didn't get rolling until almost 5pm. Our goal was to get in around 100 miles Friday night, sleep, get up and ride the remaining 110 miles on Saturday where we'd meet Dave and spend the night at his cabin near Lake Superior. On Sunday we planned to hop in the express Vokswagon back to the Twin Cities. It was a particularly appealing plan to me because it was 1.) new territory, and 2.) a one way trip. It's fun to ride places without having to worry about the return trip. Much of the route was going to be on crushed limestone and gravel, so I opted for cross tires. It seemed like a sufficient setup. For the rest of my gear I packed very light. Here's a list:  
  
Smartwool midweight and microweight baselayers Smartwool bib knickers Two pairs of socks Mountain Hardware Phantom +32F sleeping bag Marmot Alpinist bivy Bike tools (tubes, chain tool, masterlink, co2, tire lever, multitool) Four snickers bars and two bagels Knife Craft rain pants and rain jacket Ortlieb small pannier  
  
My pannier weighed in right around 8 pounds. Not bad. Jeff traveled equally light.

Once we were moving we made good time. By the time the sun set we were out of the city and heading towards William O'Brien.

We continued making great time to Taylors Falls. Jeff was at the front setting the tempo (I used the excuse that I had a much more visible rear light setup with a Light and Motion Vis180 and a Superflash) and we made only one short stop. After a somewhat nervous descent into the city we stopped at the gas station to fill up on water and pick up a few snacks for the road. Only one woman seemed interested in what we were doing riding our bikes on a Friday night. Everyone else just opted for mildly curious or scornful glances. After crossing into Wisconsin we made our way up some insanely steep residential streets to meet the Gandy Dancer trail.  
  
It was dark by this time, but the nearly full moon and my Supernova E3 lit up the trail quite well. However, whenever I looked at the speedometer I saw that we were bumbling along at some pretty slow speeds. *Strange*. I couldn't decide whether I was hitting the wall, if we were on a continual uphill, or if the trail was simply soft and sucking the energy out of my legs. In any case, we continued, intending to ride until about midnight. I don't really remember much of this part of the ride. I just kept pedaling and trying to keep my mind from drifting into negativity. Night has a way of doing this to me. I persevered and around midnight we started keeping an eye out for a place to stop. We were about ninety-five miles into the trip, just short of the goal that we'd set for the day. With and entire day to ride on Saturday everything seemed to be going well. We found a nice spot near an abandoned sportsfield. Tall grass and some shelter from the wind offered the greatest promise of a good night's sleep. Since I didn't have a sleeping mat I gathered some tall grass and made a makeshift bed in hopes that it might offer a bit of comfort and insulation. To my surprise, I fell asleep pretty easily.  
  
I woke up a few times throughout the night. It got cold. I shifted often trying to find a spot on the ground that wasn't cold. Inevitably I accepted my discomfort and drift back into unconsciousness. Morning finally came. I slept longer than I'd intended, mostly because I didn't want to crawl out of my bivy into the cruel, cold world. Finally we both got up and packed our things. The inside of my bivy was soaked from condensation. Sleeping setup: fail. I'm very pleased with the bag (I'm much more comfortable in this bag than the previous North Face bag that I had that was rated to +20F), but I don't think the bivy is going to work for me.  
  
We stopped at the nearby Holiday station. I lingered longer than I would have liked sipping shitty coffee. We expected both a brutal headwind and rain around 1pm. With dry roads leaving at 6-7am would have put us in good position to finish before things got too unpleasant, or at least that's what we thought. It was past 8am by the time we left town. Within a mile I needed to shed some layers and Jeff had to take apart his derailleur to remove a rock that was lodged in the upper jockey wheel. Once we were moving again we finally finished off the Gandy Dancer trail and arrived in Danbury. We were well behind the pace that would give us the best chance of avoiding shitty weather.
