thirty minutes on the fluid trainer and i get off feeling dizzy. because i’m getting sick. i can feel it gathering in the back of my throat when i speak and in the cobwebs that sink into the back of my skull when i try to think. it’s 3:20am and i work in less than five hours. i can’t sleep because? i watched unforgiven while i pedaled. with subtitles. they were English translated from English. the words didn’t match the letters. how do i get a job translating English into English and vice versa? i need to learn to sleep at night. but it’s sick. and i’m restless. and i can’t even answer what i’m trying to write about. because i want to write about it all. at once. and end up writing about nothing. in stuttered verse. and misspelled… and i did it. i listened to the electronic blip of the numbers dialing and i made it through all eleven of them without panicking.
