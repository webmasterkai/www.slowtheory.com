As I loaded up the bike, I couldn't help but approach the weather with a measure of disbelief. It seemed utterly perfect. The sky was blue, it was cool (but not cold), and the wind was coming in such a way that it would be almost perpetually advantageous. The plan for the day was to ride to William O'brien state park where we'd have lunch and relax, before turning around and riding home. My fully loaded bike must have been right around 100 pounds, but with the aid of the wind it propelled itself easily forward like a sailboat. The route seemed simple enough足ride down the gateway, pick up Jeff and Kara, and then meander the final few miles to the park. After reaching Jeff and Kara's house we decided to backtrack a bit in order to fortify our meager provisions. Four guys walking around a suburban C ub Foods in lycra is a lot more eventful than you might imagine. Most people simply stared, looking puzzled, angry, confused, or some combination of the three; however, the cashier demanded an answer to what was apparently a very irritating riddle. Once we answered that we were on a bike ride and wanted to eat food, she seemed slightly more content, although she did have a series of follow up questions and exclamations. We rejoined the trail and continued north. 

The ride to the end of the gateway was uneventful. Once at the end we were each assigned a turn to remember, as I had only five written down on my sheet. Unfortunately through combined fault of google maps and my lackadaisical preparation we managed to get the first turn wrong, riding south and into the wind for a few miles before I finally conceded that I'd screwed up. By the time we'd recovered those miles Ryan flatted his rear tire. We unloaded his xtracycle and began a group repair that could have probably been done more quickly and effectively by one person. Camaraderie!

Once rolling again we discovered that the road that I had intended us to take was gravel. As I was riding two inch Big Apples I found this little surprise to be delightful. The rest of the group, especially those with narrow tires, didn't find it quite so charming. It was short lived and we were soon back on pavement. The remainder of the route was quite pleasant, with little car traffic, some trees, and plenty of rolling hills. 

At 3pm we rolled into the park. Some parts of our lunch were better than our previous day tour, and some were worse. We were able to cook the food this time and the weather was absolutely serene, but the volume was drastically wrong. Too much food. Too much drink. And so on. I gorged myself on hot dogs, chips, potato salad, beer, and cookies until I was sure that my seatpost would no longer support my ass. Still, we had leftovers that were either discarded or loaded back on the bike. Riding with ten liters of liquid and returning with 7.5 liters of liquid seems counter-intuitive. Oh well. Each time we're improving at something.

Some calculations yielded the result that we ought to leave the park quickly. Through misnavigation and generally poor preparation we'd managed to add twelve miles on to the first half of the ride. The hill out of the picnic area was steep足probably in the 8-14% range足and provided an unpleasantly jarring effect on legs that had been enjoying a mid-day respite. About half way up it was a cacophony of horrible derailleur and chain noises. This struck me as very funny and I struggled to laugh and breathe at the same time. Not everyone found the hill quite so hilarious. 

We took a different way home that was advertised as being flatter. In the end, it certainly was, but the first thing we did was climb a very long, somewhat steep hill. Karma got the better of me and I couldn't shift into my small ring, so once again I struggled up the climb while trying to suppress my laughter, except this time in a more difficult gear. The benefit of this is that I made it up the hill much faster and had a chance to eat candy and drink water at the top. The rest of the ride wasn't very exciting. We took a very flat highway and ran an informal cargo bike paceline. It worked fairly well for cheating the wind and before long we were back at the gateway. Near the end of the gateway I pushed the pace for a couple of miles. After turning on to Arlington Matt made a comment about it, to which I responded, "I don't like to be on the Gateway around dusk足too many idiots." He paused and said, "...says the guy leading a train of cargo bikes at twenty-plus miles per hour." Touche! The hill on Arlington and an ejected beer bottler were the last remaining challenges. I thought briefly about riding another twenty miles to get the century, but the thought of spending another hour-plus on the bike seemed exceptionally boring. Overall it was a very fun ride. Day tours ftw.
