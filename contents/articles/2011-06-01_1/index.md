For a variety of reasons, it has not been a particularly eventful year cycling for me. I have not been logging as many miles, and I either didn't start or finish each of the two spring events in which I had hoped to excel. I have thought a little bit about what to do with the rest of the "cycling season". Michelle just forwarded me information about the "Powderhorn 24". It sounds mind numbing, but in a potentially fun way. Additionally, we're planning a bike tour for June 17th-20th. The route and general direction are both undetermined, but it will be a loop comprised of 70-90 mile segments.** I think it's going to be delightful. Aside from that, I don't have any grand ideas. It's 18 weeks until Twin Cities marathon, so once again running will begin to dominate my free time. I think this might just be a year to appreciate bikes in a much more casual way. Nonetheless, my miles so far this year:  
  
- January: 501.20 
- February: 434.6 
- March: 285.2 
- April: 766.2 
- May: 772.7 
- **Total so far: 2759.9 ***(-1423 from this point last year)*
