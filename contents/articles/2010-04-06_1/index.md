sunday evening I decided to try to cheer myself up with a multimodal trip to ryan's to watch a movie. I pulled my alpacka raft out of the closet, spent an hour relacing a new seat and then packed up my bike.

the water was calm and free of motorized things and the sludge that tends to accumulate towards the middle of summer.

I started at cedar lake and intended to paddle to the area where lake of the isles meets calhoun.

I met ryan at lake of the isles and we paddled together for a while. there was a bald eagle on one of the islands. I tried to get a picture, but the light conditions were poor. my new seat performed well. I have always had trouble with the old one and finally cashed in on the original "free replacement" offer. I hope the original was simply defective.
