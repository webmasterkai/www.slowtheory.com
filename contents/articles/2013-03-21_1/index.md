Some days stick with you. Etched so resolutely in your mind, you know with utmost certainty that you have just experienced something that will shape the person you are for the rest of your life. Such situations are reliable only in their unexpectedness. Weeks, months, and years go by without really connecting to the people who comprise our life-landscapes. We fail to progress beyond that formidable situation of convenience, learning nothing about the emotions and experiences that have yielded the present. Instead, we rely on circumstance to explain our compulsions and tangled webs. 

The implicit assumption is that all people are kind of the same, but I have little evidence to support that. I am affected. At times I become breathless with the intensity and complexity of living a human life. My lip quivers, and I want desperately to wake up and shuffle away, depriving myself the self-governance that so easily transforms into expulsion of fate. I tilt my head, hoping to reduce the gravityâ€¦or if nothing else, to increase the perception of physical gravity to match that of my mind.

The day seemed very much like any other day. There were certain pragmatic concerns to be addressed, and once expressed, considered very little until *the moment*. Perhaps I invited it. No, I *did invite it*. This was different. No. Really. It was probably the same. I don't know. The raw intensity struck me in a remarkable way, at once more poignant and considerable than even the most striking tangible matter. Here, the words, thoughts, and self-conceptions turn(ed) into a muddled amalgam of understanding and misunderstanding. I immediately became panic-stricken by the departure from our ordinary standard for interaction. 

Was it personal investment? Brotherly love? *Culpability*? Sure, I'll be guilty, if necessary. Like any microcosm, it can expand outward until it finds truth. So, I confess, but I am equally sure our complicity is mutual, if only different. It ceases to be about the ownership of choice, and delves into the explanation of choice. Concerning ourselves with ownership is pointless for people like us. A life like mine cannot be lived without conceding that its course is solely self-directed. Isn't that apparent in all of my choices? Likewise, isn't it in yours? I would never accuse you of pandering. I would only accuse you of being a dreamer and believing too much. 

Here, I stop, because I've reached the point of simplicity. The thing you want to hear is, "It's my choice." So, I say it. The thing that I want to say is, "I love that you dream, and I care." So, I say that too. And really, that's all there is to it.
