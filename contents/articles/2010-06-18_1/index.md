things have not been going well for me. depression. anxiety. regret. loneliness. isolation. I decided earlier in the week that I needed to do something about it. at the time I thought, *it is strange how embarrassing this is. *when you have a problem with your teeth, you go to the dentist. when you have a broken arm, a doctor. I have never been embarrassed to go to the dentist. even with the poor state of my teeth after not seeing a dentist for ten years I strode confidently into the office and said, *here's the problem. fix it.* I have never done that with my mind. in part, I have thought myself *above it.* I grew up in an environment where absolutes ruled and talking about problems was considered dwelling. *stiff upper lip*. don't talk about anything bad because it might make someone uncomfortable. never admit that you failed. there's good. there's bad. etc.  
  
but my world is complex. things are not good and bad. topics are not taboo. things simply *are.* I try to talk in a real and meaningful way, without the artifice and trickery of the bullshit that people feed each other. no one likes this. they like convention and ritual, ensuring that exchanges are equitable. if, for instance, I decide to expose the inner workings of my soul, the equitable response would be for the person I am talking to to expose his or her inner workings. alas, no one wants this. it's too much, so the exchange is pathetic and inequitable.  
  
I digress. today I went to talk to someone. *therapy. *I navigated a horrifying maze of hallways. locked doors with keypads. gift shops. call centers. what the fuck? strange urban center that contained *humanities.* I reached my destination, almost turned back, but forced my way forward. sat quietly in the lobby. then introduced myself. timidly. not knowing where to stand. she offered me tea or coffee or water. *no thank you*. twice I had to say that. the second time it was awkward because it was apparent that no one ever says *no thank you*. from there things changed. I found myself talking openly. with detail and sentiment. uninhibited. this woman was a good fit.
