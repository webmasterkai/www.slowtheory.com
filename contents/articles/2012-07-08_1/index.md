The Afton Trail run was amazing. I kept my effort in check, while fully appreciating the scenery and the overwhelmingly fun environment. I planned on writing a much longer post, but the experience really defied description. My body felt great, my Hokas kept my feet happy (on only their second run), Michelle passed off delicious treats to me, and the park&weather were downright splendid. I couldn't have hoped for a better introduction to trail running. I even finished fairly well, placing 119th out of 300 finishers, in a time of 2h38m for the 25km course.  
  
I'm not sure if the Hoka Mafate would appeal to me if I didn't have a fractured bone in my foot, but given my situation, they absolutely blew my mind. I only logged two miles in them before the race, but experienced no pain, only one very small blister, and excellent performance. I think there's a very good chance that they could create new possibilites for me of doing increasingly long trail runs.
