I had kind of a lackluster year for fitness related things. Aside from the Hilo marathon in March, I feel like I didn't push myself at anything. This resulted in either *phoning it in* or not participating at all. I want to change that for 2012. I need to stay motivated, push myself and enjoy the accomplishments that accompany challenging myself. That said, this is a preliminary list of events that I'd like to target in 2012:  
  
January: 

- Polar Dash half marathon 
- February: CIRREM 
- March: Get Lucky half marathon 
- April: Ragnarok 105 
- May: Almanzo 100 
- June: Dirty Kanza 
- July: Afton trail run 25k 
- August: Minneapolis half marathon 
- September: Superior trail marathon 
- October: Heck of the North or the Almanzo gentleman's ride  
  
In other news, I was visited by *bobby brown dog.*
