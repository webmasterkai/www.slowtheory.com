Sunday rides returned today. I was excited. I've grown bored with riding alone, and always in the same places. After bingeing on pugsley in September, I rode it very little through October and the first part of November. That needed to change, so the plan was loosely: fat tire adventuring. We met at the bike shop and departed to our super secret beach ride route from last year. I didn't have very much fun the last time we did the route. It was cold and the risk of falling into the river seemed terrifying. I was also riding pugsley v1 with fragile wood fenders, an annoying and poorly geared internal gear hub, and uncomfortable handlebars. It was different this time. I was in a good mood. I was happy to be spending time with my friends and the weather was phenomenal. Through the people tunnel. Along the beach. Forest. Hobo camps. Whatever. It was fun. We went to the other side of the river and it was not as much fun. Most of it was unrideable due to higher water levels. Hike a bike. Scaling an absurdly steep embankment. Etc. We ended up at a water crossing that we easily rode last time we were there. It looked less promising. Dogs were swimming. Hmm. It was an adventure ride, so I had to try. My first attempt failed, but not spectacularly. My front wheel was entirely submerged, I hit a rock, had to put a foot down and couldn't get started again. Against my better judgment I then tried to cross where the channel was narrower. It would be deeper. I knew it. Nonetheless, I went for it. I was doing fine for the first few feet, but then the bottom dropped unexpectedly. I flipped dramatically over the handlebars and landed in the murky river water. I had been wise enough to give my valuables to ryan prior to my attempts. Later I would throw them back into my bag because a cursory glance failed to reveal the water pooling at the bottom of the bag. That would be a painful mistake. Phone = destroyed. I would much rather have ruined it flipping dramatically into the river than stupidly putting it back in my bag without thoroughly checking for water. Damn. In any case, it was an otherwise wonderful experience.
