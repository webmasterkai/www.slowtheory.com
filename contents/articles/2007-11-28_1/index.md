This seemed worth writing down: 

> He pulls the trousers on. "Well...in simple layman's language, the whole delicate symbolism of the amnesia derived from the ambiguous nature, in both its hypostatic and epiphanic facies, or the diegetic processus. Especially in terms of the anagnorisis." He begins tucking in his shirt. "Thus Dr. Delfie."  
"Dr. Delfie?"  
"Obviously."  
"Obviously what, Miles?"  
"The futility of trying to deal with it causally." "I thought she was trying to deal with it sexually."  
He looks up impatiently from tucking in his shirt.  
"The sex was just a metaphor, for heaven's sake. There has to be some kind of objective correlative for the hermeneutical side of it. Even a child could see that."  
(...)  
"Serious modern fiction has only one subject: the difficulty of writing serious modern fiction. First, it has fully accepted that it is only fiction, can only be fiction, will never be anything but fiction, and therefore has no business at all tampering with real life or reality. Right?"  
He waits.  
She nods meekly.  
"Second. The natural consequence of this is that writing about fiction has become a far more important matter than writing fiction itself. It's one of the best ways you can tell the true novelist nowadays. He's not going to waste his time over the messy garage-mechanic drudge of assembling stories and characters on paper."  
She looks up.  
"ButÂ­"  
"Yes, all right. Obviously he has at some point to write something, just to show how irrelevant and unnecessary the actual writing part of it is. But that's all."  
He starts tying his tie.  
"I'm putting this in the simplest terms for you. Are you with me so far?"  
She nods. He ties his tie.  
"Third, and most important. At the creative level there is in any case no connection whatever between the author and text. They are two entirely separate things. Nothing, but nothing, is to be inferred or deduced from one to the other, and in either direction. The deconstructivists have proved that beyond a shadow of a doubt. The author's role is purely fortuitous and agential. He has no more significant a status than the bookshop assistant or the librarian who hands the text qua object to the reader."  
"Why do writers still put their names on the title page, Miles?"  
She looks timidly up.  
"I'm only asking."  
"Because most of them are like you. Quite incredibly behind the times. And hair-raisingly vain. Most of them are still under the positively medieval illusion that they write their own books."
