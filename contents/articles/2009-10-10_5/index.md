I have not been writing regularly. A lot has happened in the past few weeks. Most notably, I am moving. Tomorrow. I am moving to Minneapolis. It's something that I've wanted to do for quite a while. Life here has grown stagnant. I wake up in the morning and by the evening I am not the person I want to be. I will not be in an apartment complex. It is the main floor of a duplex. Hardwood floors. Bay window. Near the farmer's market. Etc. Life is never quite what I expect.

This is the atrain. He is a malapropist. Or he suffers from aphasia. I'm not sure which.

This is a view from the swamp where we camped last week. It smelled like urinal and jet fuel. As we were lounging in slop, getting bitten in the face by spiders, the atrain offered some of his food to alex nelson. The interesting thing about alex nelson is that he is secretly very funny. Much of this comes from his innate ability to accept and adapt to a situation no matter how ludicrous it seems. In this instance the atrain asked him for a "reciprocal" instead of the "receptacle". After a time alex nelson produced a loaf of bread as barter

(this is the other reason he is very funny...he always has strange things in unexpected places). Atrain was dumbfounded. "Isn't it good enough?"
