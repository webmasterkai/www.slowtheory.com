I couldn’t believe how real it was. You came back to me and there was that implausible moment when we were only a few feet from one another—that moment where the body forgets exactly how to move. It was unbearable to think that we should be apart any longer. We curled up together and spoke in joyful sobs about the space that we’d left between, overwhelmed that at last we’d been returned to one another. I woke up holding you. But you weren’t there. Not yet. I almost cried. I wanted to sleep there forever, forever in that perfect dream. I looked at the clock and twenty minutes had elapsed since my last glance. It wasn’t a dream. It’s still happening. Somewhere, waiting to find me. I laid in bed for another thirty minutes, dying. I miss you so much.
