walking entranced  
by the indigo *starscrapers*  
my mind suddenly jumbled by a clanking  
salvation army worker  
who I promptly punch in the face  
consumed by guilt or diffidence  
I donate one-half of my savings  
to make amends  
both for my indiscretion  
and poverty itself  
honey  
I've lost this much money  
and I hold my hands wide apart  
like a child  
this much  
I repeat  
she shakes her head and it's over  
How shall we separate the cat?  
you ask  
I have no opinion  
so we go our own ways  
with one half of a cat each  
beneath the majestic indigo *starscrapers*
