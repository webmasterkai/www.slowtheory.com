It is morning at the bike shop. We have been open for ten minutes and so far the door has not opened. Hungry. I decide to take an early morning sandwich break. The phone rings. Rehearsed. I invoke artificial fluctuations of tone. See? Not monotone. In four days I will ride my bicycle to Rochester, race my bicycle, and then ride home. Looking forward to it much less than I should be. Three days drenched in sweat, tipping over with fatigue. I will return home filthy and broken. (hold me) Summer and winter, I am different people. Different habits, different levels of curiosity and mental acuity. Now, representing a perfect state of change, an imperfect tense, bodies draped almost clinically over their props. Not like this. I am not like this. I'm always dreaming. Reverie. I am lost in reverie.
