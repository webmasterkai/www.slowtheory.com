#### Attempt #1

the witching hour  
and I emerge from a swell of insomnia  
bleeding with a god in its infancy

the insistent fingers  
and I writhe  
from biomechanical shackles  
pleading with a god in its delinquency

the imperfect answers  
and I wince
from unassuming mortality  
seething with a god in its inadequacy

the hollowed eyes  
and I relent  
from wordless nowheres  
kneading with a god in its delicacy

...and the midnight hour waits for my scream
