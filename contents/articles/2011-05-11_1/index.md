I've spent the last couple of days mentally and physically scrambling to figure out my Almanzo setup. After assessing the opportunities for water on the course (none) and just off the course (few), I begrudgingly conceded that I would need a hydration pack. I don't like carrying things on my back, but I'd really like to avoid a repeat of last year, which found me knocking at the door of a random farmhouse and awkwardly trying to explain my predicament. The woman was wonderful and one year later it makes a nice story. However, the 162 is already going to present a vivid enough backdrop for *stories* that I don't need to trouble myself to create more.  
  
After riding on Saturday I thought I had my bike set up perfectly. I had installed the same Hutchinson tubeless tires that I rode at every gravel event last year. The rear was looking a bit worn, but I was sure that it wouldn't be a problem. Well, on my ride home from work last night I was greeted with the unmistakable hiss of stan's being spewed from an unsealable hole in the tire. Tubeless usually works pretty well: the sealant seals any flat that isn't devastating. After Almanzo last year I pulled the tire off and found a couple of blobs of congealed sealant that would have otherwise been moments on the side of the road. This hole wouldn't seal. A-train helped me change the flat and I sullenly got back on my bike with the knowledge that I'd also need to spend money on a new tire. I'm currently debating just running my 32mm touring tires. If the gravel is loose, they could be disastrous. If not, they'd probably work just fine.  
  
Everything else is coming together nicely. My frame bag works fairly well and generally stays out of the way of my legs, my gearing is optimized for speeds between 5 and 25mph, my bike is mostly comfortable and Michelle is going to be a sweetheart and drive me to the start of the event. Most of my friends have dropped out of the event, so I don't need to worry about orchestrating anything else with other people or not being able to keep up. Soon all that will be left is getting on my bike and pedaling between eleven and fifteen hours. No problem.
