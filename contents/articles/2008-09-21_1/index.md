Matt and I raced in the new belgium urban assault ride today. Teams of two rode around Minneapolis taking on obstacles such as big wheel racing, bike limbo, oven mitt bottle cap pickup, newspaper toss, and mini-bike racing. It was extraordinarily fun and we finished pretty well, probably in the top 20 overall out of ~250 teams. There were also three mystery stops that didn't have obstacles, but needed to be found. Afterwards we drank beer until they ran out and then went home. A great day.
