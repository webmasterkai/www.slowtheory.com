I slept well most of the night, waking up shortly before sunrise refreshed and energized. My body was getting into a rhythm with hiking, sleeping, and eating; and despite my cough sounding truly morbid, my illness was subsiding. I wanted Michelle to have ample opportunity to rest and recover, so I didn't wake her up. Instead, I built a fire to combat temperatures that were in the high twenties to low thirties, as evidenced by the frozen hose on my hydration pack. I ate breakfast, watched the sun rise, and speculated on our ability to cover the 22 miles to Lutsen in a single push. This was "plan A".

Michelle woke up just after 9am, and once we had breakfasted, were on our way. When I had last checked the forecast, we were facing a 20% chance of rain. Within ten minutes of leaving camp, we were digging for rain gear that I had optimistically buried toward the bottom of my pack. It would not stop raining for the rest of the day. Once at the Cascade River loop, we found that a bridge was out on the main SHT, so we detoured to the spur trail. Given our late start, disintegrating momentum, and sinking spirits, we soon confirmed that the 22+ mile walk to Lutsen would not be happening. However, that didn't mean that we didn't want to reach Lutsen, sleep inside, and enjoy some frivolous luxury.

Despite the ruthlessness of the rain, we soon found ourselves lost to the wonder of a marvelous section of the trail. The Cascade River roared and churned, seemingly swollen by the unending wetness, creating dramatic sounds, smells, and sights that brought me back into the moment. Nonetheless, we were moving painfully slow. Over the course of the day, we would average only *one mile per hour* on the trail. Yep. Sixty minutes per mile. Michelle's knee was obviously giving her trouble, making the choice to seek shelter in Lutsen an easy one, leaving only the logistics of actually getting there.

We eventually reached Highway 61, thinking that we'd certainly encounter someone leaving the park who would give us a ride. Sadly, our exit was not a typical state park entrance, with only a few cars unceremoniously stashed in a parking lot. I was still confident that we'd be able to start walking south and quickly pick up a ride--the rain ought to pique a driver's sympathy, no? No one had stopped by the time we reached a nearby restaurant, so we took shelter and calculated our next move.

I halfheartedly suggested offering a trucker lunch for a ride. Before that thought had any more time to percolate, the gentleman asked us where we were going. Michelle explained that we were trying to get to Lutsen, to which I quickly added, "Any chance we could get a ride from you?" He offered a look that suggesting  he wasn't excited about the situation he'd stumbled into. After a long pause, he replied that he could give us a ride, but we'd have to be sneaky as the corporate company for whom he was working had the cab rigged to video record any unusual activity. We couldn't speak loudly or hit any crazy bumps. No problem.

Once we were on the road, the tension eased and we fell into comfortable conversation. Thirty-five years of driving trucks provided stories and personality that made the jaunt to Lutsen quite interesting. He dropped us off at the bottom of the hill and we began the two mile walk to the lodge. Just before reaching Caribou Highlands, I joked, "What will we do if they're all booked up on this rainy, cold Thursday?" Moments later, I received a shock when they were completely booked for the weekend. *What the hell?* I couldn't imagine what people were doing in Lutsen before ski season and after the warm season. We would later realize that Minnesota educators were doing that weird thing where they give everyone a couple days off under the guise of bettering education.

I panicked, but a quick phone call confirmed that we could stay Thursday night at the next lodge up the road. We trudged another five minutes, arriving at the office ready to pay any amount of money for a warm, dry room. Our next dilemma was deciding what to do next: shower, lunch, or Jacuzzi? It was a fine problem to have, and our sharpened problem solving skills resolved that we would simultaneously fire up the camp stove in the room, turn the shower on, and the fill the Jacuzzi with water. Self-indulgence would be a mild assessment.

Our heightened state of wonder at modern convenience made for an exquisite evening of doing absolutely nothing, but appreciating every moment of it.
