![DSC_0719_1133](http://f.slowtheory.com/9236722595_c1cc444779.jpg "DSC_0719_1133") After taking a month off from running, I only had two weeks to get ready for the Afton 50k. I did what I could in that timeframe, but I went in to the race feeling significantly less prepared than I did for either Trail Mix or Ice Age. The break was motivated by a mild case of plantar fasciitis that emerged after the snow melted and routes became consistently *pavementcentric*. Upon returning, I experimented with different shoes, ultimately deciding on the Hoka Bondi 2 for the race. They felt weird after a winter of running in minimalist shoes, but they offered the highest degree of foot friendliness for the increased mileage and punishing downhills of Afton.

I borrowed A-train's car, greatly enjoying the simplicity of waking up early, gathering my things, and heading out alone. At 5am, driving conditions were peaceful. The sun was working its way towards the horizon and the world was quiet. I arrived at Afton, picked up my race packet, pinned on my number, and immediately got in the line for the port-a-potties. After navigating the line, the announcement was made that the race would start in five minutes. Perfect. The typical pre-race announcements were made, and we were off. 

I made a point of starting slow. I've learned that in a 50k, there's a lot more time to be recovered in the last ten miles than gained in the first. Goal number one: run ten miles without increasing perceived effort. The race started at 6:30am, but it was already feeling hot and humid. After cruising through the first aid station, I made another mental note: don't cruise through aid stations. Staying hydrated was going to be crucial. I took my time at subsequent aid stations, making sure I filled my handheld and consumed at least one additional glass of water/HEED/ginger ale.

The thing about Afton is that the downhills are eminently runnable…even for a poor descender like me. During the 25k in 2012, I spent a lot of energy running fast uphill, and then didn't have much left for the downhills. I decided to try something different this year: run slow uphill and faster downhill. It seemed more sustainable for 50k and would allow ample opportunity  to comfortably drink from my handheld while going uphill.

It worked well, and I reached the 10 mile mark feeling pretty good. At this point, I set the same goal that I did at the Ice Age: reach 20 miles still feeling like a human being. It's a simple goal, and open-ended enough to be achievable in just about any scenario.

The rest of the first lap went pretty well. I stopped at my drop bag to get some ibuprofen and a Lara bar. I'd eaten almost nothing the first lap due to heat-induced nausea. We were either down in the ravines where it was shaded but ridiculously humid, or up on the prairie where the sun was relentless. Nonetheless, I forced down a Lara bar. Before leaving the start/finish area, I stopped at the port-a-potty to inspect the color of my pee. Goldenrod? Sunglow? I went back and chugged another twenty ounces of water before finally starting the second loop.

I didn't realize it at the time, but that was probably a crucial decision. I felt like shit for the next mile or two while things settled, but after that I began to feel much better. I reached twenty still feeling like a human being. In fact, I felt good enough that I started thinking about *racing*. For the first part of the event I had just held my position, flip-flopping repeatedly with the same people based on our speeds up and down the hills. Now, I started passing people. I focused on two very runnable stretches around miles 24 and 26, running 9:00 pace and passing at least a dozen people. I slowly hiked away from a few more people on the climb and then widened the gap on the descent. I felt good…so good, in fact, that my speed outmatched my diminishing coordination, and I soon found myself sprawling face-first in the dirt. It was a soft fall, and I got back up excited that I would be able to ride that wave of adrenaline for a bit. 

I finished strong. My time was 5h46m, which was good enough for 59th place out of 200+ starters. It was a bit slower than my other 50k races this year, but given the conditions and difficulty of the course, I'll take it. My GPS registered around 3700 feet of elevation gain, or around 120 feet/mile. Crazy!

The Bondi 2 was perfect. My feet felt better than they ever have at the end of a 5+ hour race, and there wasn't even a hint of plantar fasciitis reemerging. Given my lack of training, it's staggering that I can say that. I may just have to embrace my fate as a Hoka runner.
