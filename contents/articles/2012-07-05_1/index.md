The observed high for yesterday was 101F. That's not my kind of thing. I can adapt to the cold, but heat inspires me only to curl up, nap, and wait for it to end. As such, I've skipped even my last minute training for the Afton Trail run this weekend. I'll just go out there and see what happens. Stated succinctly, my goal is: finish while having at least some--possibly "a bunch of"--fun. I had anticipated training more for this event. Getting molded for orthotics changed that. I decided it would be better to ease off, get through this event, and give the orthotics a proper chance to do their thing. I'm just going to look at it as an opportunity to try something new. Unlike a road race, where hitting the wall means either shuffling mindlessly with nothing to stimulate or inspire, I will be in the woods. In the very worst case, it becomes a fifteen mile hike in a rather beautiful world. My only problem? Figuring out which shoes I should wear. I have my road shoes, and two pairs of trail shoes. Both of the the trail shoes are almost completely untested. **UPDATE: **going to give the Hokas a go. Went for a brief afternoon run down by the river. I think I will get a blister on the broken part of my foot, but it should be bearable for such a "short" distance.  
  
Twenty-eight days until I move. I am thrilled. Although my current neighbors lack the straight-up-awful of their predecessors, it's still a place I don't enjoy living. We've started moving some of my things. It's getting more real. Sleeping in the basement and high-fiving sweaty palms. Go!
