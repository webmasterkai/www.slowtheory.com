Now it's my turn: I've started to think of myself as a predator, vacillating disinterestedly on anything that does not pertain to positions of exchange. For this reason I subject my peers to a specific kind of thought treatment. Using particularly gentle words and cultivating happy images I arbitrate a mediocrity that suits my predatorial behavior. I suppose it is much less being a predator and much more attempting to be a victim, for the best predators are the most blatantly victimized. 

So goes my preface. 

Followed by calculating the minutes until my half clean laundry will need to be moved from one machine to the next. Piecing together a sandwich. Pulling my tongue back, venomous, full of distaste and dislike. Lurking, predator in the shadows, a mandated silent orator. Casual as a likeness projected in shadowscapes on the bathroom wall. Not hearty enough to never be alone. 

So I observed her without noticing her footwork, aware only that she moved from rock to root with ease, with solidityÂ­--stalwart and defiant. And I, condemned and motionless, a lurking large predator, limbs motionless, gliding tick-tick-tick as she pressed through the obscured opening. Sunlight dripping back the dirt. Then gone. Working around the other's sound, the mere presence of a condemned soul. Wandering, burned in the sunlight. Wax simplexes. I heard her footsteps and she, certainly, my tussling. The stripes of pain shooting from my fingertips to my elbows, and motions of dissolution. I dream, I dreamt. Weeping in the cemetery where once, then twice, then finally. Soon ancient, then ill defined. It was not until later, in the high conditioned state of mind called fervor that I came to appreciate the comeliness of that regularity, that inability to force anything beyond the conservative featurelessness of silver fucking minds, decided fucking wills. This or fucking that. Not until later did I understand that the arbitrariness of it was irrelevant, that any such thing occurring in spacetime alongside a host of obligations and regulations would seem equally as stupid, equally as unlikely. So unlike the future fabrications of my mind, segregated from the dull, dim din of everything that cannot simply be abandoned in a moment of divine appraisal, the thing would be as much a surprise to the script as it was to the participants. 

So goes a new weak imitation of anarchism. 

So fucking happy birthday, puppeteer. String puller. Bitch. And he/she/it doesn't have a chance to disconnect from these pale notions, these ideas of relation between what is and what could be.
