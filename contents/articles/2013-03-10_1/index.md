Since I am now making an attempt to live life more openly, I will confess this: I find Strava motivating. It's not the silliness of blasting dangerously through an arbitrary section on a route, or the joy of amassing tallies that positively or negatively position a person amongst his or her peers. No. No. It is simply that it is a mirror, drawing attention to the unbending reflection of the pursuit of one's happiness. I have ambiguously riffed on that topic numerous times before, so I will keep it brief. Basically, I went for a twenty mile run in the rain on Saturday because Strava told me to (sic).

Michelle and the Lucy, the neighbor dog, joined me for the first mile and a half. Once we reached the gravel road, they turned back and I started splashing around in the mud. Much of the world was underwater on Saturday, and no stretch illustrated this better than the one kilometer between the tennis courts on fifth and the paved section leading to the Stone Arch bridge. I ended up slogging through the wet snow covering the railroad tracks, as the road was completely submerged. I still had the dream of keeping my feet warm and dry.

I continued on to the Cedar Lake trail. After not seeing anyone for the first hour or so, I encountered a cyclist. "Tim!" Peter was on his way to retrieve a business car from the impound lot. We had a laugh, a hearty handshake, and set off in opposite directions. I felt good on this section, reaching Dakota park rather quickly. 

At this point, my mind started to play tricks on me. I hadn't really planned the route beyond, "run to Dakota park and turn south until you hit the Greenway." As I ran south, I questioned the reality of my situation, tricking myself into believing that the street numbers in Saint Louis Park should mimic those in Minneapolis. After 28th, I expected to find the Greenway. I did not. I thought about turning back, but after stopping for some water, I continued onward with renewed vigor. Eventually, things became familiar and I found myself on the Greenway.

It was nice to be on the multi-use trail where the deep pools of water were less frequent and more navigable. My feet were hopelessly soaked, but I was spared the biting cold of re-submerging them. At mile fifteen, I stopped at Freewheel for coffee. Aw, respite. 

The break was nice, and I left Freewheel feeling strong. I finished the twenty miles feeling pretty strong. My feet were in good shape, and while my body was tired, it was not twenty-mile tired. This bodes well for the upcoming running season.
