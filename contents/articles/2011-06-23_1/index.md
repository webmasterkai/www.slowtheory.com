The storms the first night of the trip were intense. Rain pummeled the tent, even dripping at times on our faces. Nevertheless, we both slept well and woke up late in the morning. When I crawled out of the tent it was still sprinkling. I asked Michelle if she was ready for a day of this. The forecast called for rain almost the entire day. I wanted to continue, but I also knew that it would not necessarily be the most fun. Furthermore, the extended forecast called for rain for the rest of our trip. My official position was *neutral*. I would be willing to ride either north or south, but wasn't particularly happy with either prospect. My morale was low. I was sick of riding my bike in the rain. Michelle showed her tenacity in saying, "*I think we should keep going." *This was the first of many times that her resolve thoroughly impressed me. We packed up our things and got ready for day number two.

The lull in the rain continued longer than I expected. In fact, the first 35 or 40 miles of the day were relatively free from rain. It never got sunny, but it didn't rain. I was excited about the route between Wild River and Pine City as it traveled a network of very low key paved and gravel roads along the Saint Croix. It was beautiful. We were almost completely *unbothered* by noise and traffic. I immersed myself in the quaint countryside and felt happy of myself.

About ten miles from Pine City I started to get very hungry. We'd been eating well, but not enough. The caloric deficit resulted in a total loss of discretion: we agreed that at Pine City we'd stop for pizza. It was 4pm. The restaurant was enormous and we were the only people in it. We sat at a table for eight and scrutinized the menu, eventually settling on bread sticks and a large pizza. As we waited for our food people started to trickle in for dinner.  
  
*Don't much care for mushrooms.*  
  
*I'll take a MICH.*  
  
*etc.*  
  
There were three beers on tap and they were all the same. No one asked us where we were going or what we were doing. This was a small town pizza place. It started raining.  
  
Because of a lack of Snake River crossings I'd planned for us to take highway 61 from Pine City to Hinckley. It has a nice shoulder and is relatively free from traffic that far north (most people use the adjacent I35), but is probably one of the most boring and demoralizing stretches of road in the state of Minnesota, especially when compared to the lovely start to the day. We put on our rain gear and pointed our bikes north.  
  
We moved quickly. I don't think either of us wanted our time on the rainy highway to last even a second longer than absolutely necessary. *Just make it to the Munger*.  
  
Finally we did. We stopped briefly at the trailhead to watch a crazy woman and her jumping dog before heading off down the trail and into more rain.

The final push into Banning was a slow one. Even though the day was one of our shorter ones at 72 miles, I felt worse than I did the rest of the trip. We made our way into the campground and located our site, set up the tent and crawled inside. I contemplated trying to start a fire, but as everything was soaked and we were in the middle of a rather lame car-campground I decided it would be better just to end the day right there. It was around 9pm. Michelle read to me for a while until I fell asleep. I was worried I would wake up in the middle of the night and not be able to get back to sleep, but I didn't wake up until late morning. It was still raining, but things were about to get a lot more awesome.
