I woke up early. A series of shadows danced on the wall, illuminating a texture to the air previously thought inconceivable. I was told earlier of the extraordinary sensitivity of the peripheral vision. I turned my head slightly, blinding my focal vision and allowing only my peripheral sense. I felt more than understood that it slithered along the wall, delicate and inarticulate, a matter of hues offset against gradations of self. Now manifest in my breakfast–”I am resilient.” Now bliss.
he walked with this stupefying posture that made me wonder how he remained upright at all, this instrument of its own life’s toxification. A perpetual, bearded wanderer–the unwilling, habitual nurturer of this thing born to the shadows that seep from man to woman. Hands joined in hands offering this, “I won’t look away from you anymore, old man.” It almost makes me laugh now, so far beyond the niggling concerns concocted by dominant men of impressions of other dominant men.
