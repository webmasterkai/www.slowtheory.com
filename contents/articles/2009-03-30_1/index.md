I knew that it was going to be a tough ride. The wind was going to be ferocious, the terrain a bit more difficult than usual, and my nutritional strategy was just plain wrong. Now, let me say something about the group. Me: tired legs going in, forty pound bike, two inch tires, coming off of a forty-six hour work week. Ryan: spent the last month blissfully free from the rigors of employment, instead spending that time getting impressively fit, twenty-five pound bike, and 23mm tires. Jeff: freak of nature. We headed out towards the Bikery in Stillwater for some late morning pastries. The wind was already a bit obnoxious. I was underwhelmed by their selection. It didn't look distinctly different from a Supermom's bakery except that there was a Colnago track bike hanging on the wall. I was hungry. Too hungry. I ordered quiche and coffee, adding a bagel of my own from my pannier. Still hungry. Oh well. It'll get better. We left the Bikery with only a vague notion of the direction that we wanted to ride. We tried some new roads, relying on my Igadget to guide us. We chose well and encountered some beautiful scenery and very little traffic. It helped that we were benefiting from a massive tailwind. As we worked our way south the frequency and severity of the hills increased. Ryan took advantage of his fitness and superior machine to dance his way up the steep inclines, while I dealt with a somewhat unfamiliar sensation: OTB. The heft of the Karate Monkey, my increasing hunger, and my generally inferior fitness meant that I was the last one up every climb. Nonetheless, it was amazingly enjoyable and I was in high spirits. Between I94 and Military road we discovered a fantastic collection of new roads. Around fifty miles we stopped at a playground. It would be the best moment for the remainder of the ride. As we turned into the wind the accumulated fatigue started to take its toll. I took a few turns at the front, but mostly I just wheel sucked for the next thirty-five miles. I usually spend at least three quarters of the time at the front, so it was unusual but not at all unpleasant. I think I'll start doing it more often. We stopped at eighty-five miles for the day. The route ended up being short and I didn't have the mental or physical strength to turn away from home to get the extra miles. Oh well. I had a lot of fun and that's what really matters.
