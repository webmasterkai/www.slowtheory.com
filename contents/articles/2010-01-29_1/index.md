I finally decided to add studs to an endomorph. it has been really icy here and the prospect of a long ride on sunday meant that I'd have to be ready with a bike that could handle the conditions. I stopped at menards on wednesday morning and picked up nuts, bolts, washers, red loctite, silicon, and drill bits. I didn't think the pugsley would need much help to be solid on the ice. I drilled fifty holes in a staggered pattern and filled them with bolts. in a decision that I'll soon regret, I loctited the nuts so that they would not wiggle loose. the silicon went between the bolt head and the tube. here is the finished product:

I have about forty miles on them so far. they have handled exceptionally on the ice, and with enough pressure they don't add that much rolling resistance (my first ride I had the pressure way too low and could scarcely maintain double digit miles per hour). the bummer seems to be durability, which I suppose shouldn't come as a surprise. still, I only have forty miles on them and they are showing noticeable wear. it wouldn't be so bad if I hadn't loctited them. I could just replace the bolts as necessary. however, as they sit I don't think they're going to get more than three hundred miles, or about two weeks of pugsley miles. sigh. I'm hoping that the embedded nut still allows increased traction. otherwise I might try cutting them out and replacing them when the time comes. I'll ride the dummy for the next two days, ride the studded tire sunday and then reassess. I could always just ride the larry during the week and save the studded tire for those long weekend rides.

I went out to do some course recon for this week's sunday ride. ryan proposed a century and I was quick to commit. I've been really wanting to do one of the lazy, long rides like we did last year. morning to night, with a ton of stops and a leisurely pace. the greenway past saint louis park and the lrt both suggested that a studded front tire was a wise choice.

I'm excited. I think it's going to be a good weekend.
