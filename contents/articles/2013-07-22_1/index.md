I had an odd, but highly satisfying weekend, of doing only two things. I worked on [our wedding website](http://www.ijustlikeyou.com) and [I ran, twice](http://app.strava.com/athletes/699136).

### The running

After doing difficult trail races each of the last two weekends, I had a goal of doing a high volume week without any extremely long or difficult runs. Saturday I ran to meet Jessica at the midtown freewheel. Even though it was warm, it wasn't as obnoxiously warm or humid as it has been recently. Once we met up, we headed up Nicollet, through Loring Park, around Theodore Wirth, through the Quaking Bog, and back via Cedar Lake. I ended the day with 18.4 miles and felt pretty good. Jessica was an awesome running pal, and the miles ticked off easily when accompanied by conversation.

Sunday, I planned a 16ish mile loop that went south on Lexington, through Crosby, and back home via Hidden Falls & the River Road. I got lost behind the Summit Brewery, and then started getting stung by some weird bee-like creature that followed me for another half mile, repeatedly stinging me, and quickly flying back to me after I would swat it away. Seriously, it was scary. I debated going into the Crosby entrance proper, but decided that instead I would run the long, gradual incline up Shepherd Road. I started to feel really strong after the ten mile mark, and increased the pace gradually. My last mile and a half I ran at 7:48 pace. After more than 35 miles in two days, I was happy to have so much left.

I finished the week with 49.3 miles, and had the opportunity to run fast a few times. It was a nice change of pace, and probably good training. Next weekend it's back to the trail. A group of us will be running the section from Split Rock to Tettegouche, giving me my third marathon or greater distance run in four weeks. 

The only bad news? I blew up another pair of Hokas. They've been great about decisively dealing with the issue, but I think the current Bondi model may just not be up to the task. This pair had only a week's worth of running on the road. I returned them to my new local running store, [Mill City Running](http://www.millcityrunning.com). These folks are fantastic. They're genuinely nice people, stock interesting products, have a clean salesfloor, and put on interesting runs and classes. They're also just a 15 minute bike ride from my house.

### The website

Michelle and I spent much of the rest of her birthday weekend finishing our wedding website. We wanted something clean, simple, visually pleasing, and well organized. While there is still a bit of fine tuning left to do, I am quite satisfied with [the results](http://www.ijustlikeyou.com). Paper invitations will go out soon, so we'll call this the *soft roll-out*.
