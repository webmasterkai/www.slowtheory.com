the air is moist. anticipation of the never coming storm. please thing. bless me. the need. the eternity. striking, is it not? I went running today after moving some things. new space. endless miles of trail interwoven through this city. wonderful. no real internet. paddling the ithing with my flippers. I am running twin cities marathon this year. surprise. life is interesting but largely unchanged. I can read again. words. I can almost think again.
