after the general shittiness of the weather getting colder I needed a weekend like I've had. it's been phenomenal. saturday night dave and I rode from my house to andover for the loon state cycling winter party. I was nervous about the route since I don't do a lot of riding in the northern suburbs, but it worked out extremely well. we spent most of our time on trails, and when we were on the road drivers were exceptionally courteous. I couldn't have been more pleased. we didn't stay long, but I did have a chance to lose dramatically while playing air hockey. it was dave's first long ride on his new pugsley. he seemed to enjoy it and did extremely well considering the circumstances and distance.

today I met jeff and ryan at the bike shop. we did part of last year's favorite winter route. I really wanted to check out the trail conditions at wirth, so ryan waited for us while we went for a lap. the trail was in fantastic condition. a bunch of pugsleys must have been out yesterday packing it down. the temperature was just about right. it was cold enough that it was not soft or sloppy, but warm enough that we could still have fun. it was smile inducing. I can't remember the last time I've had so much fun on a bicycle. we cut the ride short and I went directly home to a cup of coffee.
