i destroy beautiful things so that i will not lose them  
  
and in doing so i destroy beauty  
  
leaving me empty, vain, pulsing through the night  
  
in waves at my feet. made that way by nothingness  
  
sounds sensations  
  
muted. i make pretend with *eventualities *while its inevitability  
  
is a product of destroying something beautiful  
  
so that i will not lose it  
  
now. dripping hot moonlight like candlewax keeping her skin from mine  
  
and while my eyes tell me that  
  
i am touching her she does not feel it  
  
but at least I didn't lose it right?  
  
RIGHT? *fucking stupid.*
