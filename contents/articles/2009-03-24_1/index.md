When I awoke Saturday morning I found that I was ill with some kind of digestive disorder. Unpleasant. It seemed anomalous, certainly something that I ate. I chose my dietary culprit rather arbitrarily and moved on with my day, riding up to my sister's to drop off my tax information. It was fine. The morning was beautiful and it was very satisfying taking it off from work. After work we left for our first camping trip of the year. It was only a short overnight trip to Lake Elmo. I packed fairly light (although I still seemed to have the most gear of anyone in the group) and used my bivy for the first time in the wild. The ground was most gear of anyone in the group) and used my bivy for the first time in the wild. The ground was waterlogged. We gathered wood and huddled around the fire as the temperature plummeted from a balmy fifty-plus degrees to somewhere in the upper thirties. It was late when I crawled into my bivy. I knew immediately that I'd cut my foam thermarest too short. Normally I use an inflatable thermarest that is very easy to transport, but since I needed better insulation from the cold ground I opted to cut down the bulkier foam version that I rarely use. I cut it off around my knees, not taking into account how cold my feet would get. Other than that I was quite comfortable. My bivy was surprisingly pleasant and I was warm enough to sleep very well until about 5:30am. I was starting to get pretty cold by that point and decided that I'd get up and start a fire. The second I unzipped the zipper I started shaking. There was frost. The stars were visible. The forecast had called for clouds so I was fairly certain that it was colder than the forecast had predicted. The temptation to cling to the limited warmth that I'd accumulated inside of my shelter was strong. I got up anyway, sprinting back and forth along the section of trail leading to our campsite. I did a few pushups on the picnic table and then started looking for tinder that wasn't completely soaked. I had good luck finding some and within a few minutes had a small fire. By then the A-train was awake and helped to gather some smaller wood. I watched happily as the sun crept its way into the sky, giving way to warmth and a gentle tailwind that would coax us home. When I went to make breakfast I found that my stove was broken. I thought briefly about just using the fire, but didn't have a good way to clean the soot from the bottom of my cooking pot. I decided to eat a granola bar and call it good. It was only a short ride home. Once we were on the road we were all too warm within minutes. I had refused to change back into cycling clothes and was wearing a wool baselayer, pants, a thick wool sweater and a jacket. I took off my jacket and thanks to the relatively easy pace found myself somewhere between cold and comfortable. I got home and had about an hour and a half before Jeff would arrive for my second ride of the day.

The wind had picked up by the time that Ryan, Jeff and I left for a somewhat abbreviated Sunday ride. For the first many miles it was at our back, propelling us forward and making the fact that I was nearly starving seem somewhat insignificant. As we turned on to Como we saw a guy on a Trek hybrid cruising with the wind at about 30mph. I waved and offered a friendly greeting. His billowing windsuit barely twitched in recognition. A hybrid snob? Weird. We rode our normal winter route. It was much less pleasant though as it was littered with people walking dogs, children swerving wildly in their big wheels and so on. I generally try to avoid multi-use trails in the summer, but wasn't too excited to plan a route after camping the previous night. Around Wirth we saw that same blue windsuit, hunched posture and maniacal rocking back in forth. Trek hybrid guy. Our paths had split some twenty miles earlier, with the three of us heading down the transitway while he continued on Como. 

Wirth is narrow, so we were taking it easy on the bike trail. He was on the road. As soon as we passed him, he suddenly rocketed by, bottom bracket creaking and the clunk click of shifting across his cassette to the highest gear. As he got slightly ahead of us he kept looking back, and not in that casual way that suggests it's for a purpose other than a race existing only in his head. It was explicit--he imagined he was racing us. While he got ahead of us on the downhill, it wasn't long before I caught up to him on the ensuing uphill. I rode beside him, saying hello and asking if we'd seen him on Como earlier. Rather reluctantly he answered, "You-shore-did." I commented that it was a beautiful day for a ride, to which he made some kind of audible, albeit indecipherable response. As we crossed Olson Memorial cars began to stack up dangerously behind him, and the trail grew dense with people. In the interest of public safety, I made my silent and unacknowledged farewell to insane hybrid guy and slowed the pace dramatically, watching him lumber off into the distance like some kind of animal unaccustomed to the motion of its own body. No doubt he is still aglow with the significance of his victory. I thought many times the rest of the ride about his motivation and resolved that he must have had a bad experience with snobby road cyclists in the past. Now he lives only for revenge.

We turned back into the wind and headed home.

The next morning I woke up and found that my digestive problems had returned. After a day of good health I was sick again. I threw away most of the things in the kitchen that I'd eaten both the previous day and on the Friday prior to my first symptoms. I rode to the grocery store in the rain at 3:30am to get Immodium and replacements for the boxes of cereal that had gone in the trash. That was not fun. The rest of the day passed without incident, but I find myself suffering again this morning, though not as bad. Hopefully it is out of my system soon.
