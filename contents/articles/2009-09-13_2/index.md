The Sunday plan was to get in a long ride on the Pugsley before the Almanzo gentleman's ride next week. I didn't sleep very well Saturday night. There was a wedding party across the street. Fireworks, yelling, bouquet tossing, flashbulbs. 2am. It didn't bode well, but I woke up automatically around 6am. Got dressed. Filled my waterbottles. Stack of granola bars. I rode to meet Ryan near his apartment. It was a cool, foggy morning. I enjoyed it.

Ryan was going to ride his cyclocross/touring/commuting/road bike to the shop where we would pick up the Pugsley that he'd be borrowing for the ride next week. Both Alex and A-train met us at the shop on their Long Haul Truckers. Next we'd pick up Jeff at his house in North Saint Paul. We took a few interesting detours along the way. Pugsley stuff.

The a-train departed after we returned to Saint Paul. We ended up weaving in and around the Saint Paul classic bike tour. It was everywhere. On como we had to ride with it for a couple miles. As we passed people the fat tires did not fail to elicit excited/scared responses. "Oh my god..." It was bittersweet to see so many people on bikes. That many people are capable of riding and own bicycles, but ninety percent of them will only do so for an event.

Around mile fifty we were passing by Theodore Wirth. I couldn't resist getting in a lap. We'd spent a lot of time on the road and the Pugsley needed to see some dirt. It was a fun lap. Jeff and I rode pretty hard. After we'd finished our lap we were standing around with a group of six or seven people. Among them there was a guy bleeding profusely from his ankle. No one seemed particularly concerned. His sock, shoe and crankarm were covered in blood. "Chainring, eh?" During the time that we waited for Alex and Ryan no one suggested that he should stop riding and seek medical attention. I was thinking it. The bandages weren't doing anything. The blood continued to pool. Soon we left and I think they went to ride another lap.

It was my first time on the new Luce Line extension. It was nice. I never liked riding that stretch of Glenwood, so it was pleasant to have an alternative. The tentative plan was to ride to Watertown, seek out a coffee shop that I'd heard was phenomenal and ride home. We were flying. I was in my largest or second largest gear the majority of the ride out. We stopped in long lake for snacks. It was a warm day for September. I bought two bottles of gatorade, two donuts and an energy drink. Staying hydrated was a challenge.

It was not long before we were in Watertown. The coffee shop was closing, so we ordered our drinks and then sat next to the dumpster drinking them. Cold coffee. MMmmm. It wasn't delicious, but it was nice.

On the way back I stopped to fix a man's broken chain. Karma. As we neared Wirth I demanded that we do the last half of the south loop. It was vaguely in the direction that we were going, and mountain biking after 110 miles of riding is just badass. As we neared the first obstacle I heard something in the woods behind me. Turns out it was Alex hitting a tree and going over his handlebars. Jeff and I waited at the finish. After a few minutes we realized that Alex and Ryan hadn't taken the south exit. They were headed around for another lap. After regrouping I branched off from the group and headed towards home. It was a fun day.
