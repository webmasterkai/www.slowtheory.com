The sun does some pretty outstanding things this time of year.

Which almost makes up for the fact that I now spend 60% of my time being *too cold. *I used to have a greater tolerance for the cold (and it's not even cold yet), but something has happened to me. It might be as simple as I lost a lot of the fat that kept me well insulated. It might be more complicated. It might be emotional. Or existential. Or metaphysical. Or make-believe. Or even something else.  
  
I have been running regularly. Short and fast. I *think* my IT band injury is healing, but it's difficult to tell. It's a frustrating injury because everything is normal until it's not. I have read a seemingly infinite heap of information on the subject, and have come to the conclusion that no one really knows anything about the IT band, how it works, where it connects, and the proper classification of the tissue and/or tissues. There is the dominant theory that a tension imbalance and muscle fatigue allows it to slide across the head of the femur. Among those people, some believe that the tissue is "unstretchable" while others propose a variety of different stretches to "loosen" the IT band. Then there is another school of thought that says the problem is not even in the IT band itself, but rather in the tissue directly beneath the IT band (this group also tends to think that it is connected continuously along the femur and therefore cannot move around in the way described by the first group). Among those radical thinkers, there is then a division as to which of the tissue below the band is the principal irritant. Theories on running while recovering from this injury vary wildly and include the following: do not run for up to six months, do not *not *run because you will only allow the imbalance to grow more pronounced, run only on uneven terrain to better engage other muscles, and run only on flat surfaces to avoid the pesky ups and downs that seem to invite the most discomfort. So anyway, I've read a bunch of stuff and none of it agrees with any of the rest of it. My approach at this point is simply to listen to my body, strengthen my hips/glutes (how could this be a bad thing even if it's not the culprit?), run primarily in my Altra Instincts, and hope for the best. My short runs have been promising. I have been able to work up to a 10k distance without issue. This focus on greater frequency and shorter distance has allowed me to set some personal bests in the 5k and 10k. Both were quite slow by real running standards, but short distance isn't really my thing. Perhaps if I am forced to run like this for a while I will actually get faster.
