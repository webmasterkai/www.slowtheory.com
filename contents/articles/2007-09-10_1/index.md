The weather has changed dramatically in the last four days. Autumn has oozed from the cracks in the ground, speckling the crisp air with auburns, golds and deep shades of red. Glancing down into the depths of the river, scanning the skyline for the already committed­--flaring out in scarcely noticed droplets of early season passion­. I evaluate: summer (my life) has surged on defiantly, a white noise in which I have become inexorably lost. I am now twenty-seven years old. I am now an adult. Perhaps I have been for some time. Yet, conversation has changed little from childish murmuring, the urgent swell of poorly articulated wants and needs. Still, I want. Still, I need. Still, I am still only in those hesitancies between fulfilling one desire and conceptualizing the next, somehow pushed beyond that faux-Buddhist-idealism-or-nihilism-orwhatever-thefuck-it was of my late teens and early twenties. My toothache from three days ago has subsided.
