yesterday I set a new best time for my new commute. 31:55 for just over ten miles. I didn't try very hard until after getting through downtown. once I realized I had a massive tailwind I covered the last seven miles in exactly twenty minutes. it was a nice change from the seemingly endless backwards pushing wind of this year. on the way home I took the long route. I turned on to the greenway at the same time as a former LSC rider. we chatted a bit. eventually he ended up sitting on my wheel. no problem, except that as we passed under a bridge two pigeons refused to abandon their shady spot. not wanting to cause a massive greenway pileup I pushed boldly forward. as they finally launched into the sky I ducked, twisted the bike, and contorted my body to avoid being struck in the face. "I thought you were going to eat one of those!"

Yeah, this riding to work thing is amazing.
