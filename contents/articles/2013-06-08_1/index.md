This past weekend--the one during which we decided to retrieve the car from Grand Marais--happened to coincide with the annual MS150 bike ride from Duluth to the Twin Cities. Several of my friends were riding to the start of the event on Friday, so I decided to join them. Michelle found a ride with Ugur and Margot, so we planned to meet in East Duluth later that evening. Though logistically challenging, and serving no ostensible purpose, I looked forward to the opportunity for a long ride with friends.

The alarm went off at 3:30am. Bryce planned to be at my house at 4:40am. This left enough time for a relaxed pancake breakfast and last minute gear fiddling before leaving to meet Ken and Jessica at the Stone Arch bridge. We quickly realized that, in spite of intense planning and preparation, no one had looked at the map. We rode vaguely north, hoping that the next person we picked up would know the way to Stu, the architect of the northern suburb traverse.

While Johnny also didn't know how to get to Stu, he was more adept at utilizing his smartphone while riding. We managed to complete the journey to Stu with only one, minor navigational mistake. Stu proceeded to expertly guide us on a network of trails, grassy expanses, and roads to Hugo. It was an inspiring and imaginative route out of the city, easily surpassing my previous routes in both fun and efficiency.

Shortly after Forest Lake we detoured from the trail to stop and hang out with Bryce's parents. I appreciated the stop as the gloomy day, chilly weather, and vast distance yet to cover had me feeling a bit uninspired. After coffee and snacks, we continued down the trail.

Bryce flatted, some other stuff happened, and finally we reached North Branch. The trail ends here and funnels riders on to Highway 61. The shoulder is wide and the route quite safe, but I nonetheless have a habit of trying to get to Hinckley as quickly as possible. It provides a mental boost to complete the thirty miles of highway, pass the halfway point, and return to the trail. During the next thirty miles, I would spend twenty of them riding hard, completing two ten mile stretches each in around twenty-nine minutes.

We reached Hinckley and stopped at a gas station. I felt great. I've only been riding consistently for the past three weeks. Almanzo marked my return to cycling after spending the fall, winter, and spring running. I had not felt particularly fit either during Almanzo or the following week's Afton loop with Bryce, so I was happy to be feeling fantastic as we neared the 100 mile mark.

The trail was relaxing. The miles passed and I continued to have fun and feel great. The clouds finally parted and offered us a brief glimpse of sunshine. Around mile 135ish, we stopped at a *general store*, where I had a beer and an apple.

Around Carlton, the trail detoured. I hadn't ridden the route since the floods, so I was sad that I'd both be missing the beautiful section of trail and sent on a slightly out-of-the-way detour. Physically, I felt awesome, but mentally I was ready to be done. 

I should have done a better job of planning, but it was at this point that I finally started to sort out the details of meeting up with Michelle, Ugur, and Margot. After brief grumpiness that I had to ride for another hour after my companions reached their destination, I stopped and forced a mental reset. The ride along Skyline Drive was awesome.

I continued to awkwardly and inefficiently navigate my way through Duluth, riding up, then down, back up, then down, and so onâ€¦until finally I reached our stop for the night. Margot's family prepared an amazing dinner. I was happy to be done riding and in the company of good friends.
