it was an ambitious plan that went well for me, but was essentially a catastrophe as a ride. the first fifty miles went well. we didn't ride as a tight group, but everyone seemed fine riding at their own pace and periodically regrouping. the new rider was riding a triathlon bike and didn't like drafting, so he'd let gaps form just so that he didn't have to be too close to anyone.

I felt great. I didn't push the pace, but I tried to stay near the front so that I could keep everyone on the route. as we hit the hills I realized that things weren't going that well. the new rider was unhappy with both the hills and the road conditions. I'd warned him about the former, but hadn't even considered the latter as I found the roads to be some of the better ones near the twin cities.

we turned back into the wind. alex and I got a bit ahead and stopped to wait. new rider showed up next, put his bike down and sat at the edge of the road. I thought it was playful, making a show out of his disdain for the harsh headwind. jeff and ryan had still not arrived. "which way are we going?" he asked. thinking that he was still in good humor I deflected the question. "well I'll tell you what the problem is..." I was going to say the wind but he cut me off, almost shouting, "WHICH WAY ARE WE GOING?" I pointed and he took off. I decided to wait for jeff and ryan to assess the situation and how to get everyone home. a disconcerting amount of time passed and then jeff arrived. he explained that ryan had hit the wall and would not be able to finish the ride. I explained the situation that the new rider was up the road somewhere and probably had no idea how to get home. probably fifteen minutes had passed since he took off. we made the decision that alex and I would forge ahead and try to guide new rider home, while ryan and jeff would seek food and then abort the ride at jeff's house, which was not far from where we were.

alex and I rotated into the wind, knowing that we'd have to make up a large distance. eventually we caught new rider just after a t-intersection where it would have been impossible to tell which way he'd gone. I apologized that the ride was not what he expected and offered him food. he said that he'd hit the wall and didn't want food. for the next ten miles there was almost no conversation. when he hit a bump he'd yell FUCK in a way that made it seem as though he'd been hit by a car. eventually we made it back to the bike shop. new rider left without saying much of anything. alex and I just looked at each other with what in the hell was that all about expressions.

I don't know what I could have done differently. I tried to describe the route and the pros/cons of different bike setups. I tried to ride with a consistent effort and make it clear that it was not the type of ride where you have to stay on the wheels or you won't find your way home. it was the type of ride where you stay within view or you stop and wait for others to catch up. not everyone rides up a hill at the same speed. I tried to choose roads that were scenic and low traffic. sigh.
