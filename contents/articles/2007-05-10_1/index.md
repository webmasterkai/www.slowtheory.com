I slept pretty well last night. This happened at the bike shop yesterday: *ring ring* 

**Matt**: "Bicycle Chain."  
**Person**: "Hey, do you guys just sell bikes, or do you sell other stuff too?"  
**Matt**: "Mostly just bikes. What are you looking for?"  
**Person**: "You know...like TVs and stuff." 

I wish that I would have answered the phone. It's the sort of thing that can make a day at work much less monotonous. I went out riding this afternoon and felt absolutely miserable. Went pretty well up the high bridge, but as soon as I turned toward lilydale I found that my legs had absolutely nothing. I held 20-22mph for about two miles before I realized that it just wasn't happening. I dropped back a couple of gears and upped my cadence. Still, I felt like shit. Additionally, my saddle was bothering me and the position of my hoods seemed all wrong. I kept my cadence high on the river road, intending to work my way to the u of m campus where I would take the transitway back to saint paul. However, I only made it as far as summit before I decided that I'd had enough and cut my route short. I started off at a leisurely pace down summit, very tempted to drop into the small ring and spin my way home at 15mph. Unfortunately, a jackass on a bianchi nearly ran into me as I was stopped at a stoplight, zipping by without the slightest warning only an inch or two to my left. Once the light turned green I picked up the pace and started closing the gap. I moved within striking distance and waited for a slight rise. I pulled alongside and bid him a good afternoon. He looked surprised that I was still there, but didn't make a move to increase his speed. He dropped off and I continued my unpleasant journey home. A lot of guys on road bikes are jerks.
