I decided that I needed a new camera a little less nice than my DSLR and a little bit more nice than my destruction-proof Olympus, so on Jeff's recommendation I bought a Nikon P7000. Most of the prime photo taking opportunities in my life occur either while 1.) on foot in the woods carrying gear for several days, or 2.) on or near a bicycle far from home. I've found that I haven't been using my *nice* camera nearly as much as I should. My photos from Hawaii are evidence of that--lots of photos from a couple of days, and almost none from all of the others. I was hesitant to use it both because of the space that it took in my pack and the cumbersome nature of extracting it and setting up a shot. With my limited ability and lens selection, a high quality point and shoot will do 98% of what I could do with my DSLR anyway. I was learning a bit about the settings and took this picture of my livingroom.

This is where I live now.

(transition) I've found it difficult to get in the long runs that I will need for Twin Cities. This seems to be my story with autumn marathons. I just don't have the time, motivation and discipline to stay off of my bike in order to train properly for a running race. As of right now, I'm still planning on running, but that may change.  
  
An example: last weekend I *should* have done a long run, but instead I went on a 160 mile bike ride. I woke up at 4am to eat, get dressed and get myself to Apple Valley by 6am. I knew that it was going to be a long day, so I took the light rail to Fort Snelling. There are *interesting* people on the lightrail at 5am on a Saturday morning. A few people were obviously headed to the airport, checking their makeup and clutching at their briefcase while turning away from the riffraff. Some were returning from a night of drinking and shenanigans. Some were probably just riding because they had nothing better to do. I was sitting in lycra, my carbon fiber road bike propped next to me, eating cranberries. For sure, I was the weirdest.  
  
Once I was at Fort Snelling it began to rain lightly. I could just tell that it was the sort of rain that would pass through quickly, so I crossed the Mendota bridge and began my journey to Apple Valley. The ride was really nice. The sun was rising behind me and the air was fresh. I left ample time so I could pedal lightly and succumb slowly to wakefulness and exertion.  
  
When I arrived I found out that *only *fast people showed up for the ride. The one or two people that I counted on as a buffer between me and being off decided not to join us. My plan changed to sitting on the back. We began riding towards Red Wing. It was a good group. We rode at a conversational pace and I even took a few turns at the front. I was concerned about the amount of food that I'd brought, so I tried not to work any harder than absolutely necessary. The miles ticked off, the roads dried and it turned into a beautiful morning. Going into Red Wing we went over a climb that I last did on my Waterford, towing a BOB trailer. It was much more pleasant without the extra load. In Red Wing we stopped for breakfast. I was sixty-four miles into my day. We crossed into Wisconsin and began climbing. This was near Hager City. I'd never ridden the Wisconsin side, but I knew from others that it would be hilly. I was determined to make it to the top of each climb with the first group. The only time I got dropped was on a descent that everyone else had ridden. It was curvy and even getting thoroughly dropped I hit a top speed of 45.6mph. I wasn't going to ride faster than that without knowing the road...or maybe not at all. The rest of the ride went well. I started to get tired as we neared Apple Valley, but others were great about doing most of the work on the flats. I sat comfortably spinning in the back. It was really nice to go on a ride with such a strong and experienced group.  
  
Later that night I rode to Roseville to go to A-trian's wedding reception. It was fun. Free beer. Music. Bonfire. All of that was followed by an exhilarating ride home with two of my coworkers. It was nice.
