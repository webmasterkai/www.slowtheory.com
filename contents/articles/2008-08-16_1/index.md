Today: run with a headlamp for the first time. Become frightened by the lack of control that this body exhibits, this pale deadly thing bounding chaotical y into the immense darkness. Adjust periodically足 tilting, tipping, straining my eyes beyond the necessary point of visual feedback into... 
 
Yesterday: I hear my own voice on the telephone. Each of my words comes back to me, dull and dimwitted, in an ever declining spiral of unintelligence. Speakerphone. I hate it. Fuck that. Tried to piece together fragments of ideas into something coherent, catch myself stringing together sentences comprised of words that I don't mean, and furthermore, don't mean to say. Forces me into silence and I do everything I can to hang up. 

Two nights ago: I had my first actual dream about her. Nothing made up, conceived by will or the disinclination to find someone better and more interesting to think about. Not even imagination. Really, it was quite real, and I was amazed upon waking to find that I thought her very pretty--足not at all in the striking way that one receives a particularly colorful sunset, but rather in the insidious and clever way that a thinking mind adopts tendencies and happy prejudices. 

In a survival situation, one has to abandon his prejudices...so says the television. Evening: watched the women's olympic marathon. Almost brought to tears by the relentless suffering. Other olympic sports look only mechanical. Athletes-足machines-足replicating something that they have done a million times over. The marathon is never the same, and even the winner looks devastated. It is brilliant. I love it. Thursday: Jeff rides to Duluth in six hours and some minutes. It took me six hours to ride to Hinckley. It took me eleven hours to ride to Duluth. Fucking amazing.
