June ended in a flurry of activity. After Michelle and I returned from our outstanding bike trip, my focus shifted to getting ready to move. Much of the work remained on the day that I needed to both be out of my old place and into my new place. Temperatures were in the mid nineties with high humidity. It sucked a little bit. In any case, I'm out of my old place and just need to move some stuff from Michelle's and then it's *done*.  
  
I ended up biking a lot in June. I hope I don't bike as much in July. I need more *relaxation*.
