After spending the early part of the day lethargically stomping around my regular environment, I decided to go for a run. Before getting sick a couple months ago my running fitness was improving dramatically. Ten miles was a breeze and the callouses on my feet were acquiring the correct thickness and texture. Since then I have done a poor job of regaining that enthusiasm or proficiency, so I selected a short but difficult course designed to reawaken sleeping muscles. I have been thinking about doing Twin Cities marathon this year. It's been two years since I last completed a marathon. It's been even longer since I set about *training* very specifically for the rigors of a 26.2 mile foot race. I set out to run Twin Cities last year, but I did not make the time to adequately prepare myself and opted not to even take the start. I need better focus. So much of my time has been spent engaging with things either halfheartedly or misguidedly. Purposeless. Ten days remaining in this place. I look around and there is a frightful lack of inspiration in the way that I am living. So today I ran. Not particularly far, but far enough to remember the sensation of propelling myself forward with nothing but my own body, completely free of machinery. I liked it. I loved it.  
  
When I got home I decided that it was time to start a new blog. My old space feels just like the tangible space in which I spend most of my time: tired/used up/devoid of inspiration. It's time to start fresh in a new place with none of the words from the past haunting me.  
  
It is about vindication. Maybe that's not what I mean to say/think/do. This year at Almanzo I was a different person. I did not fail. Sixty eight of three hundred plus people beat me, but I did not fail. I had the excitement and determination that was missing last year when I decided to give up. I considered my experience and decided to be a different person. That is what this is about: *change*.  
  
The kind of change that is life affirming, inspires beauty, and revels in the capacity of the human being. Time to get started.
