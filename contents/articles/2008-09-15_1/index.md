notes from yesterday's ride: 

1. went in search of a ravine. unsure whether we found it. 
2. my seatpost kept slipping. 
3. armadillo elite tires sucked. forgot long stem tubes. brought patch kit with an empty glue tube. tied tube in a knot to get home...all acts performed in the rain. 
4. the sustained 12%+ climb away from the kinnickinnic river just about finished me. 
5. wisconsin roads never have shoulders. 
6. wisconsin drivers are horrible. 
7. sitting behind jeff is about the fastest way to travel by bicycle. 
8. maria's sustained watt output is 4.2 watts/kg.
