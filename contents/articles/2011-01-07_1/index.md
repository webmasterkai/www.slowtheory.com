*"Athletic" goals*. I have already told most people this, but I have decided to postpone the Tour Divide. There were quite a few reasons for this. It started with the final camping trip of the year. Jeff and I rode off into the wilderness and I found that, while my gear was suitable for an overnighter with temperatures in the 30s and rain, it would have been a nightmare if I had to do that for a month. Moisture management, bags, navigation, clothing, rain gear: I didn't seem to have any of it quite right. The financial commitment to rectify all of this coupled with a distinct need to reach the next level of fitness instilled a pretty deep sense of doubt going into the winter. Then I met *Michelle*. Being alone in the woods seemed much less appealing when contrasted with the possibility of sharing a vacation with her. Change of plans: Tour Divide is out, Hilo (Hawaii) marathon is in. So:  
  
*Hilo marathon*. It's going to be a challenge to prepare for this marathon as the bulk of my training will need to happen in the middle of the winter. I have been running at least once per week and have even run ten miles recently, but I need to structure it and increase the volume. Yesterday I put together a calendar and did my first *long run*. It was eight miles with complete laps around Harriet and Calhoun. The temperature was around ten degrees, but the sun was out and the trails were covered in a very soft snow. I struggled towards the end of the run, having to remind myself that running in the snow in January is different than running on the pavement when it's seventy degrees. I'll be confident if I can get in a run in early March that is at least 18 miles. My goal for the race is simply to finish while experiencing something that I imagine will be gloriously beautiful.  
  
*Almanzo 162. *There is a new version of the Almanzo this year. It is 162 miles rather than the traditional 100. Last year I attempted to be competitive in the 100 mile ride/race. I finished in 69th place (out of 300+ starters). If I had planned better on the bike hydration and nutrition I probably could have finished in the top 50. For me, that's *racing my fucking face off.* This year I'm planning a little different strategy: fatbiking the 162 with the goal of finishing. This doesn't mean that I'm going to *not try* or that it'll be *just for fun*, because finishing a 162 mile ride on a fatbike thoroughly defies those notions. Goal: finish in the allotted time, experience beauty, and get some nice photos.  
  
*MN Ironman Gran Fondo.* This is a little bit unusual relative to the other types of events that I've been entering recently. I'll be riding with a group of Veloviet riders in the Gran Fondo at the MN Ironman. This is essentially a timed version of the ride, conceived in response to those excited individuals who want to *Ride Hard*. It is a 100 mile road ride--not particularly challenging on paper. However, there have been rumblings of trying to post a time of 4:30 or 4:40. My fastest century to date is just under five hours, and that was with a nice tailbreeze. Goal: stick with the VV riders, represent the shop well, and avoid crashes.  
  
*Dirty Benjamin*. I know these roads, so assuming that nothing changes I want to show up to this thing and race it on my cross bike. It's very flat so sticking with one of the lead packs shouldn't be too terribly difficult, at least until they *put the hammer down.*  
  
*Heck of the North. *Goal: participate. It's a lottery system so that will be largely out of my hands. If I can't get into this, I may try to find some other event for October.  
  
*Ride to Dave's cabin. *I'd like to repeat the failed ride to Dave's cabin, except this time on the fatbike. The route was tantalizing beautiful after Danbury and I would love to be able to ride it rather than push my bike slowly beside it. Goal: reach the cabin via the dirty, sandy roads of northern Minnesota.  
  
I guess that's all. It should be enough to keep me motivated.  
  
Oh, and an update on post #1. *Food* is going well. I have been bringing my lunch to work and trying to eat more intelligently, responsibly, and with more diversity.Breakfast:
