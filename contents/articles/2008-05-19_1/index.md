 On Thursday I did my long run. It was horrible, by far my worst run of the year. I had contemplated doing another long run today, but instead volunteered to provide xtracycle food and water support for Joey and Ryan. Water stops have been sketchy this spring as the city has been slow to turn on fountains, and on occasion working ones have only gurgled white shit. This was part of my problem on Thursday. I got dehydrated and ran out of energy. It was a lethal combination that left me staggering home in a state resembling a mix of fever and drunkenness. To spite the vindictive cosmos, I decided to help my friends avoid such a fate. 

 The weather was marvelous. For the first thirty or forty minutes I sat against a perfectly ergonomic tree at Lake Nokomis reading a book. I haven't had a lot of time to read in the past couple months, so it was a nice opportunity to enjoy the day in a very leisurely manner. After Nokomis things got a bit more complicated as the difference in their paces increased the gap between runners. The plan for the day was that Joey would run sixteen miles, skipping C alhoun, and Ryan would run twenty miles with Calhoun included. Ryan's faster pace should have put them arriving back at the starting point at about the same time. The complicated bit was for me to position myself so that they would each have ample opportunity for water, gatorade and snacks.

 Maneuvering around slow moving cyclists became increasingly difficult. The road bicyclists were the worst as they often convinced themselves that my bell and pronounced "On your left" were both imaginary. They couldn't possibly be passed! Unsupervised children were a close second. I regularly try to avoid bike paths and especially those around lakes, but given the day's objective it was unavoidable. After finding Joey on the east side of Harriet and Ryan at C alhoun I was riding back to the south end of Harriet when I noticed that a road cyclist was drafting me. It seemed bizarre that he would tuck in behind a cargo bike without announcing himself, or that he would tuck in behind a cargo bike at all. Didn't he feel ashamed sucking wheel from a guy sitting bolt upright carrying a cooler? 

 As Ryan came around the end of Harriet I realized that I had missed Joey. I hauled ass to try to catch him, but the separated bike and running trails on Minnehaha resulted in missing him on the first pass and not meeting up again until we were within blocks of his house. After escorting him home I went back and found Ryan also within a mile of the finish. In the end I missed each of them at crucial moments, but given the logistics I was happy to have been as successful in the first half as we were. Logistically it was a challenge. Hopefully next time it will be better.
