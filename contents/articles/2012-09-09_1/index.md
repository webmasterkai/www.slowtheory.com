Whew (redux). It has been quite a week. We have interenet access again, so it's time to start catching up. For now, brief accounts (which may or may not be followed by more extravagant tales in the days to come).  
  
We moved into the house. It was a chaotic and stressful thirty-six hours or so, but we managed to get everything in the new house while maintaining a thin grip on our collective sanity. The next several days were spent organizing, envisioning, and enacting. There is still a lot to do, but the bulk of it is in place.

I wish that I would have taken more pictures, but there wasn't time.  
  
The past three days have been spent near Lutsen. On Saturday I completed the Superior Trail Marathon (or Moose Mountain Marathon, as I guess it is properly titled). The past two months have been largely devoted to "life stuff", so I did very little to prepare for the event. The IT band pain that I've struggled with the past couple of runs surfaced around mile six. Nonetheless, I pressed on and hobbled to a mid-pack finish. More on that soon.
