Due to some last minute logistical/emotional/propulsional (sic) challenges, Bryce could not attend the birthday ride that I planned in his honor. After a couple other last minute cancellations, I expected that I might be riding solo. To my surprise,we not only started the ride with five people, but one of them was celebrating a birthday!  
 
The morning was pleasant. Winds were light, the sunrise was idyllic, and the forecasted rain seemed like an impossibility. We made good time to Chaska. Christine and Jessica took a planned detour to get back to Tedfest and birthday cake. The rest of us continued on to the gravel road section of the route. The roads were soft, it began to rain, and the wind picked up. It was delightful. I had an opportunity to test all of my gear in conditions very similar to those at Almanzo last year. Conversation quieted. Although we were only just removed from the urban bubble, it felt like we were miles from anything. I expected that the rain would stop soon. It didn't. Upon reaching Watertown, it was mutually decided that we needed a coffee break. My initial plan had been to ride without stopping, but the slow gravel and wet conditions warranted a break. We were ~65 miles into it.  

After refueling, we hit the Luce Line. Rather than stopping, the rain picked up intensity. The amount of fun being had was generally less. This is where the *practice* began. The mentally unstimulating route, coupled with poor conditions, offered the perfect opportunity to* test my mettle*. The miles ticked off and I began feeling less and less like crap, until at about mile 80 I declared, *"I feel great!" *I still felt that way when I rolled up to my door at 100 miles (after looping around the block twice to get the extra 0.5).  

**Things that worked:**  

Frame bag: It did everything nearly perfectly. Even though I didn't design it to be waterproof, it was essentially dry inside at the end of the ride. Hammer perpetuem: I've been avoiding crappy food lately, but during long bike rides I struggle to eat enough whole foods to stay energized. Having 810 calories in a water bottle was a big advantage. The Crux: I really love this bike. Its benefits were especially apparent in the foul weather. The discs would periodically rub due to gravel accumulation, but stopping was reliable, relatively quiet, and didn't grind away at my expensive rims. Furthermore, the ride was superb. From my position on the bike, to the handling characteristics, I couldn't have asked for better.  

**Things that almost worked:**  

Hydration bladder in frame bag: I designed the bag *almost* perfectly for a 2L bladder. However, I made it just a touch too small and I cannot fill it entirely. While I am hesitant to entirely recreate the bag, it might be worth it for those extra 10 ounces of water. Additionally, I need to come up with a better system to affix the hose to my handlebars when not in use. Magnets seem like the obvious choice. Mavic rain jacket: Considering my history with rain jackets, I probably should have put this in the first category. It worked much better than any other rain jacket I've ever used. It kept me mostly dry, and was comfortable for the entire ride. However, it did begin to soak through after a few hours. Specialized captain control: These were pretty good, but I think I want something less aggressive. Set up tubeless, they are a supple ride and offer great traction, but are probably overkill for the kind of use they're seeing.  

**Things that didn't work:**  

Hydration strategy: I didn't drink nearly enough, and when presented with an extra opportunity, I didn't take advantage of it. I got the typical electorlyte pangs around mile 70, and suffered for a few miles before correcting the situation. In warmer weather, I'll certainly need to do a better job of managing my water consumption.
