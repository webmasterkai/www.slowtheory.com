It was a nice year for cycling. We had a tolerable winter, an early spring, a cool summer, a delightful autumn (except for that one month), and heavy early season snow that made transitioning back into fatbiking quite pleasant. I had the opportunity to ride with interesting people and didn't really fall out of love with my bikes during the year. Because of this I was able to spend much of my time riding and very little of it *obsessing over my stuff.* My goal of the year was 10,000 miles. I didn't quite make it, finishing with **9584.24 miles**. It was still a great year made better by bicycles.
