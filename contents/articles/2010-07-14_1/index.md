it is morning. humid. hot. my skin is crawling. there are storms approaching. I can feel them in the uneasiness that mysteriously afflicts me. I focus on my breathing, easing it from frantic to deliberate in no more than a moment. I need to remind myself that I have control over the way that I breathe. it is a small thing, but it makes me feel better.  
  
sitting and listening to the water cooler gurgle every thirty seconds. four ounce glass. this woman sprawled in her chair next to it refilling gulping, suffocating. glass after glass. deciphering through my blurred periphery...*what is wrong with her?* I cannot force myself to meet her eyes. there is too much madness in the sound of the water cooler being slowly drained. elsewhere people speaking on behalf of the *unspeaking*. conceived, paired, projected, defined, recycled. here I swallow my shame and reach out my hand.  
  
later. tangling while locked in paralysis. the accumulation of potential energy. staring at the sky and reciting conjecture.  
  
this small child understood language. she walked confidently and handed her father the key to his truck. the woman was displeased with something. I systematically tried to subdue the tension by awkwardly smiling. I have observed but failed to master this technique. still I try. later still. the technique of smiling at strangers, making eye contact, communicating primitively. I have observed but failed to master this technique.  
  
I check my mail. *nothing*.
