With the Almanzo 162 only a week away, I knew that I needed to get in 100 over the weekend to test both my fitness and my gear. Both did well. I made some modifications to my frame bag the morning of the ride, and they worked wonderfully. Combined with a small seatbag I'm confident that I'll be able to carry everything that I need for the 162. While I'm definitely riding slower this year, I didn't get tired. My legs had a lot left in them at the end of the ride.  
  
The weather was beautiful. The gravel made its perfect sound. It was a good ride.
