When I was young I loved reading choose-your-own-adventure books. It was exciting. The thing was *mine*. Now, gravel racing is my grown up outlet for that same sense of curiosity and excitement. Plots emerge. Characters develop. Lessons are learned. Expression is expressed. Beauty is manifested through the willful perseverance of the human spirit. ETC.  
  
When I lined up at the start of the race, it was with my girlfriend, Michelle. We planned to ride it together at a leisurely pace. The sky was overcast and it was just starting to rain. It wasn't long before riders were stacked up in the muddy trail section. A crash and then a fallen tree immediately split the group to pieces. The rain was intermittent, never forceful, but always lingering. We pedaled happily along, content in spending our Saturday getting muddy and riding our bikes.  
  
Around 40 miles Michelle decided that she didn't have 107 miles in her legs. She's been busy all spring with household projects, and has been limited to commuting and only the occasional pleasure ride. Plot twist. I continued on alone, intent on catching up to friends and finishing the ride. I periodically encountered people I knew, said *hello*, and went on my way.  
  
I pushed on to Watertown, where I refilled my water and ran into Almanzo organizer, Chris Skogen. After he finished his can of soup, we went out for the last thirty together. It was great to have a riding buddy for the last stretch. Chris was riding strong on his chicken and stars, so I benefited immensely both from the company and his riding.  
  
We rolled into the park for a 7h30m finish, and 110.13 miles. More importantly, I recaptured the thing that I most value about gravel racing--the adventure.
