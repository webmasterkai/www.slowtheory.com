In the past ten days I have not traveled more than two miles in any direction, so riding twenty-five miles today was something akin to an all night double century in the rain. I hadn't planned on riding at all, but as the day went on I realized that I needed to get some fresh air and exercise. 

Everything was quite uneventful until we reached the Marshall/Lake bridge underpass. I had purposely detoured around a similar underpass near the U of M campus, suspecting that temperatures in the low thirties would make for a high likelihood of dangerous ice buildup. The hill leading to the Marshall bridge isn't nearly as steep as the one near the campus, so I opted not to detour around it. Ryan was riding in front of me. As soon as I saw the massive amount of refreeze I slowed and took the lane to give both of us space from each other and the car approaching from the rear. We were almost to the other side when I saw his rear wheel wash out to the right. He quickly corrected, but too much. By jerking the wheel violently to the left he effectively changed course straight into the curb.

Upon inspection the bike was mostly unscathed. A few things were skewed to one side or the other, but nothing was too badly damaged.

The same may or may not be said for the rider. After straightening some bits and pieces we continued on our way. The destination was our friend Joey's new house.

Joey wasn't home. 

I was tempted to push my luck and ride a bit more, but I've grown quite frail over the course of eleven days. I didn't want to end up back at day one. After resting for a couple hours while watching golf on television I decided to test my legs and lungs running. Riding felt okay, but I could tell that my lungs have sustained some serious damage during my illness. I knew that running would be a real test and didn't expect to go more than a mile (ha ha...to think that two weeks ago 10+ mile runs were of little consequence!). I failed the test much more dramatically than I imagined I would. I couldn't run a quarter mile without stopping to walk. It was a bitch and my June marathon is in serious jeopardy. It's a shame because I've done everything exactly right since January. To think that it could all come to an end because of something over which I had no control is disheartening.
