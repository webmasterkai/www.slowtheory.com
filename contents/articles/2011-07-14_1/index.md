After a monstrous 92 mile day comprised largely of gravel roads and limestone trails, the last day of our trip seemed quite easy *on paper*. We only had to travel 55 miles and most of it was on pavement. We started the day slowly, lounging around the camp area for much longer than we did on the other days. The morning promised to be nearly free of rain, with only the afternoon and evening threatening bad weather.

After climbing out of Taylor's Falls we followed a somewhat unimaginative route to Marine on Saint Croix. In town we stopped for ice cream. It wouldn't be our only ice cream stop for the day.

From there we took a very familiar route to the Gateway trail and then back to civilization. The weather cooperated nicely and we had a tailwind (debatable) and sunshine (for sure). We stopped again in North Saint Paul for our second round of ice cream. Three days of caloric deficit left us both lusting after terrible food.  
  
It was a nice final day for our trip. Nothing was terribly difficult. We took our time, stopped as we pleased, and reveled in the glow of the warm sun.  
  
We rolled up to Michelle's front door having completed our first bike trip together.
