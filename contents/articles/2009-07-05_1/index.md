positioned, back on wall, body cast in giant bed. overture. re-begin. yesterday had a plan: packraft the creek near my house until we got tired and then bike home. a fine plan. we rode the several blocks to the creek. garbage. fucking everywhere. maddening human waste. bicycle wheels. car wheels. ufo parts. decaying crossbeams. oh, and the current was going the wrong direction. gently, though. it didn't bother me. we went thirty feet and our path was blocked by fallen trees and more human waste. "we can't quit yet." we looked at each other. of course, we would. it was filthy. foul stench. bugs hovering at the surface of the stagnant water, feasting on our rarely still bodies. "can mosquitoes actually get blood from your eyeball?" we continued on this failed mission for another forty minutes, reaching the park two blocks in the other direction from my house. "let's get out." up a steep embankment. sinking into the dense mud. putting our bikes back together on the "shore". being eaten alive by hordes of mosquitoes. this is what I do for fun. we went to wirth beach so that I could wash some of the mud off of my shoes. it was also foul. r&b bbq. omg. shit. I felt out of place. back home. still morning. reassess. in the afternoon. two sandwiches later. anxiety eating me up like cake. out for a bike ride. the karate monkey. singlespeed dirtbike. instant de-modulation. for miles at a time I just watched my shadow stretch out across the gravel in front of me. rhythmic. emptying my brain. sucked into the endless beauty and nothingness of sheer expanse. just seconds removed from the lines of cities stacked one on top of another, seemingly ad infinitum...until...in the country. farm fields and the distant sounds of cows lowing. I calculated how far I could ride and still get home by sunset. no lights and a night of vigilant celebration. I didn't want to fuck with that. I wanted to be inside, hidden away from the imperceptible danger of people acting supernaturally. an orange, an apple, and two granola bars. I stopped at watertown for more water. ha ha. blissful. motorbikes everywhere and people flowing into the liquor store like doped up salmon. I hid behind a tree and ate my apple. easy enough. right? unromantically I pedaled my way home. wanting the distance to shrink. wanting to be sure of myself. kicking words out of my mouth with silent heaves, evocations of sweat and hissing breath. I'm getting fitter. seriously? maybe. there were animals lined up along the trail. deer that I cannot believe have not been shot for lack of survival instinct. "hey, that's a runner over there." rabbits. a field of a thousand rabbits. I quietly thanked emptysky that I was not afraid of rabbits or I would have fallen to the ground in the throes of sorrow. I got home, pretended dinner, ate ice cream (thank you darling), and tried to get to sleep.
