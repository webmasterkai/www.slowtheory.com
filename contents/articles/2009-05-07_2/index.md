It was an impromptu plan. 'Do you want to go camping tonight?' "Sure." The evening forecast called for thunderstorms. Whatever. We decided to camp at a top secret location along the river. It wasn't far away. Ride fast. Pack light. The strong thunderstorm narrowly missed us, leaving behind one of the most amazing rainbows I have ever seen. I felt like riding towards it, trying to touch it. It was just that real.

We left the bike shop shortly after 8pm. Not much daylight left, so the pace quickened. I think of it and chuckle--a caravan of loaded bikes cruising at road bike speeds. My gear included: 45 degree Kelty sleeping bag, hammock, bagel, two granola bars, one liter of water, knife, extra rope, wool baselayer, sunflower seeds, and personal items including phone, wallet, camera, etc. Sub-24 overnight trips are the latest craze on bicycle touring blog sites, and it's not particularly difficult to understand why--it's fun, low stress, and fits tidily into otherwise busy lives. Next week I might ride down the luce line wednesday night and then return thursday.

We set up camp next to the river. It was dark. A barge passed. We scurried. I've never stealth camped in a hammock before and even though the likelihood of a barge driver noticing or caring about some kids camped on the shore was rather low, I felt exposed by the blindingly bright lights. I climbed into my hammock around 11pm. I did a much better job tying it off this time. It was taut and very comfortable. It's quickly become my favorite shelter both for its packability, high level of comfort and general childishness. It makes me giddy.

I slept very well until 2:30am. I was cold and had to piss. It wasn't a cold night, but I've never been warm in my Kelty bag, even at 55 degrees. I should stop using it. I woke up a few more times during the night due to the cold, but otherwise slept very well. We got up around 6am, packed up, and started towards home.

I stopped at a park on the way home, mildly heartbroken, and looked at my feet for a good ten minutes.
