I've been waking up with headaches for the past week. I don't know if it's been because of illness, fatigue, over-exertion, under-exertion, or lack of intracranial activity. Something is making my head hurt. In the evening I watched Rashomon. 

It's a gray, cloudy morning now. The weather is strangely intertwined with my temperament. The fan working tirelessly next to the window makes the air feel light and breathable. For the past two weeks the air has felt heavy and wet, like I'm breathing through a thin layer of mixed concrete. It hardens in my lungs. I'm suddenly winded at the top of a flight of stairs. I wonder if I suffer from an acute case of asthma or if my heavy, wet lungs are a product of something else. Friday night I was at D-'s playing nintendo wii. Since I had last visited he had made a character fashioned out of impressions that he had of me. I protested its face, at which point B- jovially exclaimed­--"It does look like you! Look, his eyes are sad and his face is sort of indifferent to everything." I wrote these lines down on a paper plate because they seemed extraordinarily funny at the time. Maybe because it takes such a proclamation from a seldom held acquittance to realize how attuned some people are to the people around them, how intrusive even the most seemingly benign glances can be. I would have never guessed that someone so infrequently known would observe such things. 

I had a good conversation about books at the bike shop the other day. I don't recall how it started, but one of our customers--­a former history teacher­--started talking about a series of letters passed between Shelby Foote and Walker Percy that had been collected over the course of many years and recently published. He lent me the book and I'm using it to try to get back into a regular reading habit. It's difficult to micromanage forty-eight hours of work, regular tasks, a meager social life, marathon training, bicycling and intellectual pursuits. Sadly, marathon training and intellectual pursuits have suffered the most as a consequence of the snowballing tick tock. 

We tried to have a picnic over the weekend. It didn't work very well. There was a strong wind that made the grill almost impossible to light and a trio of crackheads tried to solicit our food, money, etc. I'm rarely a violent person, but they really fucked with the ambiance of what was supposed to be a relaxing day in the park. I wanted to kick their asses.
