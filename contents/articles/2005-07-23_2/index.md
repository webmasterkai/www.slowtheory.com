#### Attempt #2

I am here where breath ends with a catastrophe  
starting now with the corpse at my feet  
ice dead against belligerent limbs  
whose words are swallowed by bloated hopes  
and swollen and bloody tongues  
who thinks now the bated, “Why?”  
the corpse who struggled and clawed  
who clung to scattered things that I kick with my feet  
who held another as she went stone still  
who lies here where god drips in infancy  
I'm lonely for the rapists and the killers  
the weary men and the desperate women  
I scream for the corpses to shake it off  
tell me I'm not alone here  
where god isn't sure  
and the deranged run wild.
