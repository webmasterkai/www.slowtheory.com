Sunday was excellent. Early in the morning I went for a run. The IT band ached a bit, but not terribly bad. It's going to take a long time to completely rid myself of the injury, I'm afraid. Nonetheless, it was really nice to be outside enjoying the crisp, near-autumn morning.  
  
After that I went to Menards to get a grill.

It's been great having a Big Dummy in the household again. I sold mine when I moved to Uptown, but now Michelle's is regularly available to me.  
  
Late afternoon brought our first, unofficial, not-at-all-our-housewarming outdoor BBQ-fest.

Next comes the realization that I need to get ready for interbike! Oh crap.
