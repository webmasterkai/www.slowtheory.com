After a brief glimpse of spring, winter has temporarily reemerged. I must admit, I don't mind. Even on the seventy degree days the attic became sweltering and stuffy, seasonal allergies bookended my day, and the world felt too busy, and textures hard. I will adapt, but I will also miss winter.

My Almanzo weekend plans are crumbling. Michelle and Bryce both changed their agendas, which has left me without transportation and weekend-friendship. Friendship can be substituted elsewhere, but transportation may be more difficult. Current projections suggest the following outcomes:

- Doug borrows an RV and drags me along. This sounds FUN.
- I rent a car. I've been thinking about joining Hourcar, and even though it would be expensive for a two day trip, it's something that might come in handy in other situations. Additionally, they cover insurance. This is great since I don't have car insurance of my own.
- I solicit neighbors, friends, and family for a car for the weekend.
- I bike there. This strikes *me* as absurd. This is rare. Usually even the most idiotic things strike me as plausible until I'm sitting on the side of the road calling Michelle for a ride.
- I find a kindly Team Radish friend to safely deliver me.

Since this has officially become the post in which I update the world on the statuses of inconsequential experiences, I will continue to frantically topic-jump by announcing that I received a replacement for my defective Altra Instincts. The local sales rep was friendly and accommodating and singlehandedly revived my faith in the company. We'll see how the shoes fare compared to the previous generation. 

And finally, I went to the gym today. It's been several months since I've gone to the gym regularly. I hope to change that. In spite of the fact that endurance training is my focus, I have become weak and one dimensional. I'll never be good enough at running to justify doing it at the expense of my general well being. Time to lift some weights! (albeit light ones, and repeated many times)
