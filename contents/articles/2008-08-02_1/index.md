I decided to do a trail run at battle creek this morning. The tricky thing about battle creek is that no matter which way you go, it's a bitch to ride there. I loaded up the dummy with four water bottle and my running shoes. It took me about 50 minutes to ride there. I was pretty tired by the time I reached the park and couldn't figure out how to lock/hide/carry all of my valuables. Poor planning resulted in a camera, a cellphone, a wallet, and a few other items that I wasn't totally comfortable leaving in my freeloaders. I left the cellphone and camera, resigning myself to the fact that I could lose either and not be totally devastated. Fortunately things were left untouched. Battle creek is a mess of ski trails and bidirectional mountain bike trails. It's an easy place to get lost. After running for a while on the ski trail I found the turn for the steep, washed out mountain bike descent. The tricky descent is followed by a number of punchy uphills. It was at this point where I basically went into the red zone and stayed there until the end of the run. Still, it was extraordinarily fun and undoubtedly excellent training. The ride home was less fun. It seemed to take forever and I felt weird in my running shorts and jersey on a bicycle. When I got home I tried to upload my gps data, but motionbased is perpetually broken. I only took my gps so that I could find my way back to the start, but I'd be curious to see the elevation profile.
