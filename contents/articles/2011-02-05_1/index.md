**Weather:** temperatures in the high teens, fog, and mist/snain/sleet in the latter half of the run.  
** Distance: **~14 miles   
**Time: **2h25m including stops   
**Notes: **It took me a long time to find a good rhythm, but once I did I felt very good. Around the 7.5 mile mark I stopped briefly to get some water and squirt some hammergel. I **HATE** "nutrition products" like hammergel, but carrying calories while running is difficult. I carried about 3.5oz in a small "flask", which yielded around 450 calories. This was awesome. In the past I have trained without having anything during my runs. I am sure that fatigue was amplified by the fact that I didn't have any energy. Even at marathons I've never carried anything with me, instead relying on random people in the last few miles to hand me yummy snacks. It seems like a good place to improve my performance. The rest of my run felt great. I had a little bit of tightness in my left calf around mile ten, and I flirted with a blister on my right foot, but nothing was particularly uncomfortable. Well, I shouldn't say that. Nothing related directly to my forward propulsion was terribly uncomfortable. However, because of the snain/mist/sleet in the final hour my shirt began to severely chafe my nipples. I powered through it, but when I got home I found two disgusting splotches of blood. Gross. Painful. It's the first time in my running *career* that I've suffered the affliction that seems to plague many distance runners. Overall I'm very happy. Preparation has been fun and mostly successful. I feel like I'm at a point where I might be able to go into this marathon feeling confident and prepared.
