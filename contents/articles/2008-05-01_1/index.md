I decided to borrow ryan's forerunner in order to gather some data from my run today. I hadn't run in at least ten days, and hadn't done a run longer than ten miles since the pre-bronchitis era (i.e. February). The first part of the run felt great. I could breathe easily for the first time since the illness, and the combination of a generally downhill course and an occasional tailwind made for a great start. As I was crossing the Lake Street bridge I noticed an unpleasant hot spot on each foot. It was something I fully anticipated given the infrequency and brevity of my running. I was also getting extremely thirsty. Fortunately the hand pump on the Minneapolis side of the river was fully functional. Around mile seven the hot spots made their magical transformation into blisters. Additionally, I had descended to the level of the river, meaning that it would be a series of unpleasant hill climbs to get home. I made it home in fairly good time, and given the headwind and the hills felt unexpectedly fresh. I'm in a position now where it's within the realm of possibility to be prepared for Grandma's in June, although it's still something that will take a rare combination of good luck and clever planning. After the run we went to Good Earth for lunch. Our waitress was batshit crazy, but I liked her.
