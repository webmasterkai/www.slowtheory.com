After lusting after one since frostbike in February, I finally decided to trade in the trusty crosscheck and my old xtracycle for a Salsa La Cruz. It's essentially a cross bike with disc brakes, very solid parts, and a sexy paint scheme. Today was my first real ride on it. Here's a bulleted list of my thoughts: 

**Positives**: it rides nice­--very stable and without the slightest hint of a shimmy on downhills, the geometry is perfect and sports a longer than normal head tube with just the right amount of top tube slope, super sexy paint, very nice parts all around but especially where it counts­the wheels, brakes, etc. They clearly put a lot of thought into the bike and came out with a unique product that will benefit a lot of people. 

**Negatives**: mounting stuff is difficult. There aren't any rack braze ons and the disc brake is in its traditional spot on the seat stay rather than inside the triangle. The stock gearing is awful for a bike not designed to be raced (and since discs aren't allowed in sanctioned races, it seems that IS how it's designed to be used). The 39/48 up front with a 12-25 cassette is about right for road racing, and with the 130bcd crank and 10 speed drivetrain the lowest possible combination is 38/27. A 110bcd crank and 34/48 chainrings would be much more appropriate. The rim strips are also super shitty and need to be changed out unless you want to be changing a flat every ten miles.
