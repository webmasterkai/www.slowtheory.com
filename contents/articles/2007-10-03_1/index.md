she watches him away from her. now now. not frightened. ­an inscription nearby patterned out in decisive metals reading "exit left to downtown." her eyes drift glaze cloud over, waiting idly to exert all of their will should he turn around should he look back. this last once. she writes him off then and there. she thinks how little effort, once committed to the notion, it takes to hate someone. now she hates him. it turns on like a switch. she forgets that she ever loved him. she goes in search of drink and cock. 

now he forgets her. busies his hands with dinner and dishes. he thinks proudly that he did exactly the opposite of what every fiber of his body told him to do. so it must have been right because right decisions are difficult. he beams with the difficulty of it. he fucking beams. later the benign image of "exit left to downtown" returns to his mind. the scene distorts and his feet are in front of him. he hears the enumeration of steps in his head pounding out the rhythm of his inspired decision. 

her eyes are half closed­. puffy and bruised and she loves her ugliness. she tongues a cigarette while her legs mechanically shuffle nearer a place where she lays down uncomfortably in her wrinkled clothing and sleeps. she hates the way that she smells and doesn't dream anymore. too much noise with little deliberation. 

his body blanket stiff. looking up at the unfinished paint on the ceiling. the uneven edges. recoiling at even the slightest brush or tensely maneuvering in pieced together shudders. what's wrong? what's wrong with you? it keeps asking him. it brushes its hand on his face and he grimaces. the text has grown crooked. shouts madly. forgetful. 

the thoughts are becoming brief infrequent hazy. 

she looks around and in the dim recesses of her mind she knows that has grown tired and lazy. used up. stitched up. she turns her hate at a butterfly just to prove to herself that she can. she can hate anything. it just takes commitment. she's grown tired of commitment using her up spending her spitting her back out as broken tired weary shit. she still hates him but passively. she's so much above him on her cloud of hatred that she can poke and prod his idea like a labrat. 

one day he thinks of her. it's suddenly over. time passes in a spiral and the next thing that he remembers is accidentally meeting her at a hardware store many years later and exchanging ruined looks.
