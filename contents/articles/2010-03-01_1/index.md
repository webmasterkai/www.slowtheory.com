after looking at the forecast for sunday I knew that I needed to get in a long ride. somewhat surprisingly alex, alex and chaes decided to join me for the middle fifty miles. we met at the bike shop. not only did everyone show up, but everyone was at least ten minutes early. awesome. since the bike shop people habitually race up the first few hills I made a special point of asking everyone to take it easy early in the ride. I didn't want anyone bonking in the first thirty minutes.

we started towards saint paul, went past the start of the vento and started up mounds. chaes was surprisingly strong on the climb but keeled over at the top, spending ten minutes dry heaving and dripping snot from his face. I gave him some warmer gloves and tried to keep the group moving. it seemed like an ominous start. 

we made it through the series of climbs that led us to military road. I was surprised to see that chaes was still hanging in there. once we were on military road he pulled a typical chaes maneuver and found his way to the front, hammering at 23mph. I sat on his wheel and admired his tenacity.

we stopped for lunch. I distributed the cookies that beth made for us and ate a sandwich. while we were stopped another group of cyclists passed in the same direction. it was exciting to see other people out riding.

we made it to the favorite part of my ride: trading post trail to indian trail. the last section of trading post trail coming from the south is especially nice. it drops about five hundred feet very gradually, making for a couple very easy, fast miles.

the rest of the ride back to the bike shop was anticlimactic. everyone survived. chaes had a few moments of glory hammering in his 53x11 and atrain got in his first ride on his new bike. as for me, I had an opportunity to utilize my XX crank. the 28-42 up front was perfect. while I looked back and saw my friends churning uncomfortably in gears that were too big, I could spin comfortably. aside from brutally cross chaining the 42, I used every gear on my bike.

my ride from the bike shop to home was very fast. I returned with 72 miles in just over five hours moving time. I decided to sleep in and cut off the river loop that was supposed to be part of my pre-shop solo ride. it was pleasant sleeping in. with a front studded tire, it was nice to average just over 14mph while not pushing myself very hard on a challenging route.
