2007 marked the first time that I've logged my cycling miles from the beginning to the end of the year. It was somewhat unfortunate timing in that I dedicated much of my recreational time to preparing for the Milwaukee marathon. Hence, my accumulated miles feel somewhat insubstantial compared with what I seem to have logged in previous years. Nevertheless, I like statistics, so here they are. 

### Total Miles 4310.79 Bikes

As the totals indicate, the months immediately before and during the marathon were pretty dismal, with August, September and October--­typically my favorite riding months­--being near the bottom. Only months with heavy snowfall were worse. Next year I intend to run Grandma's marathon, so I expect that the totals for April, May and June will be near the bottom. That's fine. Bikes aren't my only love. My primary bicycle related goal for 2008 is to avoid buying any additional bicycles. I currently have five bicycles and would like them to remain unchanged for the duration of 2008.
