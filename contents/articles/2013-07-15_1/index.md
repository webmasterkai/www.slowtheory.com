### Introduction

I've had a mixed relationship with Hokas over the past year. My first experience was at the Afton 25km trail run last year. It was my first legitimate trail run and I had a great experience, bombing the descents and feeling generally quite good. I ran in the original Mafate. Later that year, I added a pair of Stinson Evo Tarmacs to the collection. After a 17 mile run done with absolutely zero training prior to it, I began developing IT band problems. These problems were heightened to an extreme at the Moose Mountain Marathon, where I once again ran in Mafates. I convinced myself that the knee issues were a product of poor running technique and the invitation to over-pronate promoted by the Mafate. From that point until July of 2013 I did not run in Hokas, opting instead for minimalist shoes that made me focus on proper running technique.

### Enter, the Bondi B2

After taking a month off, I decided to give the Hokas another chance as I pushed towards higher weekly mileages. I knew that I couldn't go back to the Mafate after running in minimalist shoes, as one quick run around the block illustrated that it felt like an awkward brick. People, including ultra-running king Karl Meltzer, have been known to do well at trail events in the Bondi, so I decided to get a pair.

They felt pretty good out of the box. The stack height is slightly lower than the Mafate, so coupled with the reasonably muted gray, they didn't feel *totally* like clown shoes. Two out of the first three runs that I did in them were longer than a marathon. I completed these back-to-back runs in a new pair of shoes, after a month off, and had no issues doing so. I was excited. I felt like my recovery was better, and I was able to stumble my way quickly through rocky sections that would have been otherwise problematic.

### The fatal flaw 

Going out for my fourth run I discovered their fatal shortcoming: they fall apart. The mesh on both shoes was shredded in several places. I contacted Hoka customer service. They were excellent, responding quickly and decisively in their support of the product. I ended up getting a full refund and purchasing a replacement pair from the excellent new running store in northeast, Mill City Running.

However, after a week of running in the new pair, I discovered that the same thing was happening. I had put in around 50 miles that week, but they were all on pavement. I was a little bit surprised. My assumption had been that the conditions at the Eugene Curnow marathon had contributed to their demise.

I took them back to Mill City and got another pair. I already had a replacement pair in the quiver, so I began running in that pair, this time expecting that they would instantly shred. And? They did. I got another week of use and they were completely obliterated. I returned that pair to REI for a cash refund. Now I have just one pair remaining and almost no hope that they will survive more than a week of running.

It'll probably be a bit before I find out, as I need to start settling into a pair of shoes for the Superior 50. I can't be breaking in a new pair each week. I've talked to Hoka, and they have assured me that it's a defective batch that will inevitably sort itself out. I hope so. They're not the shoe that I want to run in everyday, but they are a fantastic option for fragile feet or high miles.
