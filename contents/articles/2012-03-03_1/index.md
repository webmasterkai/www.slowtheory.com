Well, after four days off recovering from wisdom tooth extraction, I'm back at work today. Bicycle deprivation, combined with picturesque snowfall, a massive tailwind, and riding my lovely new Fargo, made today my favorite commute to work EVER. I realize that most readers will probably chuckle, sigh, and say, "*Oh, that Tim, with his hyperbole and absolutes!*" But...seriously, it was the best ride to work ever. The consistency of the snow was absolutely delightful. My tires glided so quietly and effortlessly, perfectly in sync with the relaxed morning. The wind was at my back. In a moment I was perfectly connected and disconnected with *everything*. There I was, engaged with all of the little things in life that I sometimes move too quickly to fully appreciate and it was perfect. One thing I've noticed in past running races is that I am different from most of the other people, especially at marathon distance events. They are smaller and move more nimbly. I decided this winter that by spring I would look more like a runner, and hopefully the corresponding improvement in performance would follow. I am arguably 5'11" (Graham would suggest 5'10 1/2", at best), and started the experiment at 186 pounds. I am now 166 pounds. I am trying to reach 160 pounds, where I have calculated that I will be FAST...err...uhm..."fast". The following photos should highlight what I'm trying to accomplish: 

Sort of looking like a *runner*:

Not looking like a runner at all:

See?? I look like a fatty out for a 5k in the second picture. I went on to complete that marathon in 4h17m, which isn't terrible, but I hope to run sub 3h55m at my next marathon in June, and looking like a runner is going to help a bunch.
