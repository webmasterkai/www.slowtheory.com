I'm done. As I've prepared to move I have become more and more infuriated with the amount of senseless, unnecessary things that I've accumulated. This is especially true of bicycle things. Too many. Unnecessary. Fucking obsessive. It's time for it to be done. I've now whittled my collection down to two bicycles: a cargo bike and a bike for everything else. I don't need a road bike, a touring bike, a fast commuter, a slow commuter, a bar-bike, etc. It's ridiculous. And parts oozing from every corner of my existence. I've done a good job dumping things on ebay, but I also need to stop buying things. After my road bike sells I'm going to finish paying off my tab at work and move on. Fix things that break, pay for them immediately and that's it. I've said it before and failed. Do you know how you can tell I'm serious this time? Answer: the last time I owned only two bicycles was about the time that I got into bicycles. Also, I need to be. Also, I'm cursing, emphatically. Fuck credit. Fuck consumerism. Etc. Please don't buy me things. Anyone. Ever. You'd be feeding unhealthiness.
