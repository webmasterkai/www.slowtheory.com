I joined a Ragnar team just a few weeks ago. Conceptually, I'd never been compelled to seek it out, but when the opportunity arose to partake without having to conquer any logistical challenges, I had to take it. Like many silly things, once might be enough, but definitely once. So went my reasoning.

I pedaled a Nice Ride to the CC Club, where I met up with the rest of Van #2 for breakfast. Our plan was to then rendezvous with Van #1 at the first van exchange point, after which we would alternate shifts of six legs each. When we reached the exchange point, it was *hot*. Okay, it was probably only 80 degrees, but given the uncharacteristically awesome summer that we've been having, it felt unreasonable.

It wasn't long before Jaime came flying in and passed off to Jason. After sitting around, it was time for action. Immediately I became very interested in what was happening. It was a race. I didn't really care about our finishing place or time, but I was excited that we were going to take turns moving forward as quickly as possible for over 200 miles. It was primal.

### Leg #10

#### 27 kills - 7:11 min/mile - 8.2 miles

I went fourth after Bunda and Madeline. It was around 4pm, so I was happy that the temperature had already reached its peak. I set an **A Goal** of finishing my leg in under an hour and a **B Goal** of 7:45 min/mile. After a series of hilly legs, mine was long, flat, and straight, without the opportunity for van support.

I took the exchange from Madeline and immediately began running way too hard. I learned earlier that day that when you pass someone, it's a *kill*, and that that tally is proudly displayed somewhere on the van. Without any other explanation, I wanted a lot of them. I was running seven minute miles, passing people, and feeling pretty good doing it. I easily made my goal of finishing under and hour. I arrived feeling fine, but concerned that I might have spent too much energy on the first leg.

Milton and Katie rocked their legs, and we were soon at the next van exchange point. We went in search of dinner, ending up at a gross little sports bar. It was dark and the temperature was dropping. I had a renewed sense of life as we made our way to the next van exchange. The time had passed quickly, and we arrived only shortly before Jason had to take off for his leg with a belly full of jalapenos. I was tempted to sleep. The two legs prior to mine were 9+ miles each. Combined with Jason's five mile leg, it meant that I'd have about three hours to wait for my short run into Hudson.

I decided that was a foolhardy plan, and determined that I would stay awake until my turn came. The time passed quickly as we tried to distinguish one bobbing headlamp from another. Runners didn't get very good van support in this section, but not for lack of trying.

### Leg #22

#### 4 kills - 6:57 min/mile - 3.8 miles

I wasn't too concerned about my second leg. It was one of the shortest and easiest of the entire race, stretching not even four miles and being primarily downhill. After Madeline handed off to me, I began awkwardly bobbing up and down with my headlamp. The night was cool and calm. I did not envy those who had to run through the eerie, long, dark stretches before mine. There weren't as many teams to pass, as we'd already passed the majority of them, but I worked hard to catch anyone in front of me. I got to the finish in just over 26 minutes, shocked to have run that fast.

We moved quickly to the next exchange point, where we intended to try to get some sleep at the high school before Van #1 passed it back to us. I grabbed a spot on the gym floor, sad that I hadn't brought my Big Agnes sleeping pad. Nonetheless, the gym floor felt pretty damn good, and I fell asleep fairly quickly. After a short nap, I woke up feeling unusually refreshed. The sun was up and I felt ready to run my last leg.

### Leg #34

#### 7 kills - 7:03 min/mile - 5.5 miles

My last leg started with a long downhill from Oakdale to the Wabasha bridge. This provided a good warmup, while still allowing me to run pretty quickly. Running the Wabasha bridge was the only real challenge on the leg, aside from missing a split in the course and adding about a quarter mile in distance. Fortunately I sensed that I'd made a mistake and kept looking for the sign directing vans to the exchange. Eventually I found it, confirmed with another runner that I'd made a mistake, and ran back to the exchange.

Katie and Milton finished off their legs and we were at the finish. It was over. I expected 28 hours of running or watching other people run to feel like a long time, but it didn't. The layout of the event facilitated just the right balance of fun and competition. I'd definitely do it again. My team was great. We performed really well, but kept fun and camaraderie a top priority.
