Well, the short version is this: I finished in 3h59, and in doing so, achieved the sub-four goal that I set for myself after my first marathon in 2007. The long version is this:  
  
During the month of April I did not run at all. I was obsessed with performing well at Almanzo. However, the event brought only an unimpressive mental and physical meltdown, and another Almanzo DNF. I went out too hard and couldn't get my head back into it after I cracked. I returned home, looked at the calendar, and realized that my problem was now compounded: I had only 13 days to train for a marathon. Unsurprisingly, the internet doesn't offer a lot in the way of two week marathon training programs. I did the best that I could with the timeframe and went into race day feeling like I could get to the finish line.  
  
I woke up early, ate my breakfast, and got my things together. Just before leaving I realized the light rail was under construction and wouldn't be able to get me to downtown. Since the race started and finished in different locations, I didn't want to bring my own bike. Some quick thinking found me hopping on a Nice Ride for the journey downtown.  
  
I lined up near the 4h15m pace group. It seemed like a good starting point. I planned on staying around this pace until the 10k mark. I was running technology-free, so the only time checks that I would get would be from the clocks on the course. I felt okay, all things considered.  
  
The 10k mark eventually arrived, and I was just under an hour. I was breathing easily and there was some spring in my stride. I increased my pace just slightly, and set another mental goal for myself: Fort Snelling. Around Minnehaha Park, I saw my sister spectating. She would be the first of many friends and family who came out to cheer for me.  
  
I reached Fort Snelling and the halfway point. I expected there to be a clock, but there was not. I estimate that I was around 2h06m. I started passing a lot of people. It was nearly annoying as we were running on paths that did not afford ample room for such manuevering, but having been the person hitting the wall, I tried to be sympathetic.  
  
Most people walked the hill out of Fort Snelling. I decided that I wasn't going to be one of them. I ran up it and worked my way past more people. Michelle was going to be waiting around mile 20 with a smoothie. I was still feeling quite good, but I could tell that I needed calories.  
  
The stretch between 20 and 21 would prove to be the most difficult for me. The smoothie hadn't hit my system yet, there was still a considerable amount of running remaining, and it was slightly uphill. I pushed through it. By the time that I reached the river road I was feeling good again. A mass of friends and family leapfrogged me on the course. It was a huge mental lift.  
  
By this point, everyone around me looked rough. It was a mix of slow half marathoners and people who'd done what I did at Almanzo. I felt like I was the only person still capable of running. I continued to break the run down into manageable segments, knowing that reaching Franklin meant a loooonnnng downhill. *Just get to Lake St...just get to Franklin...ooooh...just don't work too hard on the downhill*. At mile twenty-six I got my first time check since the beginning of the race. I couldn't believe it. The time began with a 3!  
  
I had less than a minute and a half for the final leg. I sprinted. I didn't quite make a gun time of sub four, missing it by four seconds, but my chip time was easily sub four. I briefly regretted the one million things that I could have changed to get back those four seconds, but in hindsight it doesn't really matter. There's always a long line of runners at the start of a race, so for the non-elite competitors chip time is *the measurement*. (It's the time you are actually on the course...there's often a several minute period of standing in line before you can get to the start)  
  
I was shocked to find that for the first sixteen miles I ran 9m20sec miles. For the last ten I ran 8m40sec miles. There were 889 finishers. At 10k I was in 598th place, at 16 miles I was in 470th place, and at the finish I was 294th, pushing my way into the upper 1/3rd of finishers. I ran *a really smart race* and had good legs. Given my lack of training, it still baffles me.
