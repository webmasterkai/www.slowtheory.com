it's been a fun month of riding. I've been able to get in numerous trips to theodore wirth. most have been exceptionally fun. it was a bit of a grind for a couple days after the snowfall, but the trails were exceptionally nice today.

I'm not doing much for training for the north shore ultra except mountain biking and commuting to work. I've switched to the 48 mile version so that dave and I can ride together, so the task is not nearly as daunting as it once was. I'm sure that given the wrong conditions it could still be next to impossible to finish. I'm just going to have fun, participate in a winter race and see some fine fat bikes.

saturday ryan and I went for a less interesting but still enjoyable ride on the greenway/roads.
