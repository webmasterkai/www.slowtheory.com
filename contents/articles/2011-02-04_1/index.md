I woke up this morning feeling cured of irritability. Four days. Shifting patterns in my brain and interpretation of life-data. The power supply surges, ebbing and flowing in its glint-blue machination. Last night we stood with our ears pressed against the door. *What did you say your name was? 'Katie.' Well, I live in 305. 'This is 205.' People have been stealing my sheets out of the laundry. There was a man in the hallway. What did you say your name was? 'Katie.' *The conversation went on for a long time. I forgot most of it. It seemed like a dream, so I filed the details in the part of my brain that recalls only in unconscious, vague, dismembered sensation.  
  
Today I am tired. These periodic stints of irritability and self-directed-negative-impulse are exhausting. Coupled with work and personal demands I end in days like this: passive, pleased, tired, senseless, and ready for the reverie of relaxing sleep. I quietly hope that I haven't alienated any of the people in my life. The shift is startling. On Sunday I was giddy at the thought of my beautiful life. Suddenly, for three days I was annoyed. Most frequently the annoyance was with myself. *Think better. Move faster. What did you say your name was?* Now I am content. Nothing has changed. Collect, recognize patterns, and be what I want to be. This, I suppose, is self-improvement.  
  
I am continually amazed by the number of people who walk into businesses and try to sell steaks out of the back of their car/truck/van. *Hey, do you have Oakleys? *No, sorry. *I figured you were a bike shop...you'd have Oakleys. Oh...any of you guys do steaks at home?* No. [Sort of] vegetarian. *Wow, no shit...that's three stores in a row where there have only been vegetarians.* [Or that's three stores in a row that have experience talking to steak salesmen.] I wonder how it could be profitable.
