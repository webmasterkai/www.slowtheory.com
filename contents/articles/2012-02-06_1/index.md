I've been losing weight. on purpose. willfully. the past several years I have hovered between 175 and 185. back in the day, when I first got into running, I ran at 155-160 pounds. big difference. for cycling, it hasn't mattered all that much as the terrain around here is pretty flat and I seem to have a natural predisposition towards riding up hills fairly quickly on a bicycle. running is completely different. I'm sort of *bad* at running. but I like it. I want to do more of it, and clocking a 1:53 at the polar dash half marathon has enlivened my competitive drive to not only complete events, but perform *well* at them. so I decided that I'm going to run at 160 pounds this year and see how it affects my performance. I started cleaning up my diet at the beginning of last week and already have shown a 10 pound weight loss. perfect. sure, that's not all fat. probably not even half fat. most likely I was walking around bloated and irritable from a sloppy diet. it didn't take a lot of work. at the core of my diet is a pretty healthy one. I mapped out the nutritional profile, caloric intake, and estimated caloric expenditure of my average day. all that was required for consistent, healthy and sustainable weight loss was cutting out snacking, reducing portions, and supplementing with vitamins b12 and d3. easy. the peripheral benefit has been a renewed excitement for food. oranges taste 10x as delicious as they did a week ago. a kale salad is bliss. I'm saving money. I'm feeling good. my body is getting healthier. *habit* is peculiar. it is equally easy to propel good and bad habits. I figure I need about 3-4 weeks to get to race weight. that should perfectly coincide with the get lucky half marathon. oh, and the events have needed some revising. some complications through april, but after that it looks like smooth sailing. here it is:  
  
- **January:** Polar dash half marathon (completed 1h53m)
- **February:** Frozen fat forty (may be canceled due to lack of snow...and I have a wedding to attend the same day...boo)
- **March:** Get lucky half marathon (goal sub 1h45m)
- **April:** Trail mix 25k (pending wisdom tooth removal)
- **May:** Almanzo 100
- **June:** Minneapolis marathon (goal sub 4 hours) and westside dirty benjamin
- **July:** Afton trail run 25k and dirty lemming 100
- **August:** Some kind of half marathon mid-month (official event canceled)
- **September:** Superior trail marathon 
- **October:** Heck of the north or gentleman's ride...errr...ahhh...something 
- **November-December:** Undecided at this point, but might reserve these for training for a certain winter race I've been wistfully contemplating for years.
