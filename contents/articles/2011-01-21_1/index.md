This morning marked the coldest commute since last winter. Temperature departing was -15F with very little wind. Unfortunately I prepared for the projected -20F with a more pronounced wind. I was *way too warm.* Here's what I wore:  
  
**Head **  
  
- Smartwool neck gaiter/facemask. I modified a headband and worn out smartwool microweight t-shirt to make the perfect facemask/gaiter. It is thick at the neck but thin enough to not restrict breathing over the mouth and nose. 
- Smith snowboard helmet and goggles.  
  
**Core **  
  
- Smartwool microweight long sleeve baselayer
- Smartwool midweight long sleeve baselayer
- Pearl Izumi Elite barrier jacket  
  
**Legs **  
  
- Craft storm bib tights 
- Cheap long underwear 
- Craft (Gore) Wind Stop long underwear 
- Specialized Terrane knicker  
  
**Feet**  
  
- Smartwool lightweight messenger socks 
- Smartwool extra heavy hunting socks 
- Lake MXZ302 winter cycling shoes size 50 w/felted wool Steger insole 
- 5mm neoprene toe cover  
  
**Hands**  
  
- Pogies with storm shield outer, 1.6" (top) and 0.8" primaloft sport insulation, and nylon ripstop inner
