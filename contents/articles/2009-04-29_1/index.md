It is the middle of the night, almost exactly. Nearly 2am. I still remember in my mind, how things used to be. Nervous. Incapable of sleep. I listen very, very closely. Tomorrow (today) will bring wet earth and the maddening blankness of recessed dry eyeballs. Searching but vacant, as if not expecting to see anything. I think of the sky often, fortifying it in my mind with all manner of prosaic alteration. It remains the same. It remains an object to which I turn my head lazily, wanting newness, but finding only permutations of my own mind. Strange-her faces, look up from head buried in the grass. Smells casually. Alternate definition: an isotope of radon produced by radioactive disintegration. Nature's bespeckled frowning face, scolding me my intensity, my blatant lack of regard for self preservation. Poor biological creature, lolling stupidly amidst such intense beauty and seeking only its own complement, the thing of corresponding dimension as to mimic the bending of light through a prism.

Breathe in your precious hair, extracting not only scent but our mutual dementia. Look at me being descriptive. Air grows more toxic and poetry no longer exhibits patterns. We grow older and our dwelling more toxic. Pray, hold hands, seek out the archaic form of god not contaminated by catastrophe and inhibition. Eyeballs in sockets. Rest lazily. Dream hastily. Sundance living. Right on.

Begging evidence of nature, to nature, that at least I have made an attempt. I have not turned away from a budding flower, or scorned the precise, scientific execution of my geography bending away from the stars. I think often of the stars now, forgetting the massive space that exists between us. In the morning I will have a story to tell.
