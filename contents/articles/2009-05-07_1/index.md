On our camping trip I passed the five hundred mile mark on the frame that Atrain built for me. We celebrated the event with wild bell dinging and limb flailing. No one knows if Alex N actually knew why we were furiously ringing our bells, but he participated with as much jubilation as anyone could expect. I promised a five hundred mile ride report, so here it is:

Setup: the objective of this bike has morphed rather dramatically from its original intent, which was simply to be an economical replacement for my Raleigh Supercourse singlespeed that would simultaneously allow Atrain an honest assessment of his framebuilding prowess. Things changed when I started collecting nice parts for it: White Industries cranks, King headset, Thomson seatpost and stem, better wheels, etc. After a short time it also got an internally geared rear wheel and a swanky JTek barend shifter. In its current configuration it is an 8-speed internally geared road bike with front and rear racks.

First impressions: Even my short test ride around the block felt great. I had largely stolen the geometry from my Waterford road bike (except with longer chainstays), so there were no surprises there. It handled predictably and the fit was just right. I have proportionally longer legs than arms, so we went with a long headtube and seat tube. After a few days of riding singlespeed, I decided that I liked this bike too much to limit its versatility. I got an IG8 hub, added a front rack and made it suitable not only for commuting and fun rides, but longer distances and camping.

After five hundred miles the ride is still wonderful. It tracks well and has perfectly balanced handling, not too quick or slow. I requested a stiff bottom bracket area, and I have not been disappointed. Even pushing hard with a heavily loaded rear rack, there is little flex.

Things I would change? Certainly. Atrain didn't have an adequate jig for the rear rack eyelets, so they are not level. When I had a Jandd rack on the bike there was quite a bit of force pushing down on one of the bolts. I switched to a Surly rack with height adjustable stays and it's much better. Additionally, at the last minute I asked for a cable stop for an internally geared hub, without really expecting that I would use it. We didn't put very much thought into it and the placement ended up being quite awkward. Finally, I could go for more water bottle mounts. But overall, I got exactly what I asked for and have been enjoying it immensely.
