Sometimes noise is more irritating in its subtlety than anything else. Loud and abrasive noises I immediately recognize as things that I should ignore; however, smaller and more insidious noises unnecessarily pique my attention, subsequently providing the same level of irritation but also causing me to lose my direction. Say for example, that I am thinking words in my mind that are beginning to approach coherence. Then someone makes a small noise that they would swear had not hurt anyone, but I am left to first identify the noise as irrelevant to my safety or speech and then disregard it as bothersome and superfluous. I wonder, is it a mating call? Is there a reason for it? There is a kid at work who eats like Pacman. I have often thought of taking a tape measure and attempting to measure the maximum distance between his upper and lower lip while he eats a sandwich. This all makes me die a little bit inside. 

I suppose it shouldn't bother me that people are making these noises. Perhaps it is only that I do not have a place to escape them. Last night the people in the apartment below me left the bathroom fan on for several hours as I was trying to sleep. This may sound inconsequential, but their bathroom fan causes plastic things in my room to tremor. I had to find all of the plastic things in my room and move them to the carpet. On an unrelated note, I now have a new helmet. My Limar is many years old and has been crashed a number of times. At the beginning of the winter I bought a Bell Metro for commuting, but I needed a new road helmet since the Metro weighs ten or twelve pounds or something. On longer road rides my head would certainly bob forward as my neck muscles gave out. The specialized rep was kind enough to provide me with a helmet that is much too fast for my needs. I will look idiotic.
