From Demons:

> "All my life I did not want it to be only words. This is why I lived, because I kept not wanting it. And now, too, every day I want it not to be words."  
"Well, each of us seeks a better place. A bug in a rug...I mean, each of us seeks comfort of some sort; that's all. It's been known for an extremely long time."  
"Comfort, you say?"  
"Well, we're not going to quarrel over words."  
"No, you said it well; let it be comfort. God is necessary, and therefore must exist."  
"Well, that's wonderful."  
"But I know that he does not and cannot exist."  
"That's more like it."  
"Don't you understand that a man with these two thoughts cannot go on living?"  
"Must shoot himself, you mean?"  
"Don't you understand that a man can shoot himself for that alone? You don't understand that there may be such a man, one man out of thousands of millions, one, who will not want it and will not endure it."  
"I understand only that you seem to be hesitating...That's very bad."  
"Stavrogin was also eaten by and idea." Kirillov, sullenly pacing the room, did not mark his remark. 
"What?" Pyotr Stepanovich pricked up his ears. "What idea? Did he tell you something about himself?" 
"No, I myself guessed it: if Stavrogin believes, he does not believe that he believes. And if he does not believe, he does not believe that he does not believe."  
(...)  
"I've always been surprised that everyone remains alive." Kirillov did not hear his remark.  
"Hm, that's an idea, I suppose, but..."  
"Ape! You yes me to win me over. Keep still, you won't understand anything. If there is not God, then I am God."  
"Now, there's the on point of yours that I could never understand: why are you God then?"  
"If there is God, then the will is all his, and I cannot get out of his will. If not, the will is all mine, and it is my duty to proclaim self-will."  
"Self-will? And why is it your duty?"  
"Because the will has all become mine. Can it be that no one on the whole planet, having ended God and believed in self-will, dares to proclaim self-will to the fullest point? It's as if a poor man received an inheritance, got scared, and doesn't dare go near the bag, thinking he's too weak to own it. I want to proclaim self-will. I may be the only one, but I'll do it."  
"Do it then."  
"It is my duty to shoot myself because the fullest point of my self-will is ­for me to kill myself."  
"But you're not the only one to kill yourself; there are lots of suicides."  
"For reasons. But without any reason, simply for self-will ­only I."  
(...)  
"It is my duty to proclaim unbelief," Kirillov was pacing the room. "For me no idea is higher than that there is no God. the history of mankind is on my side. Man has done nothing but invent God, so as to live without killing himself; in that lies the whole of world history up to now. I alone for the first time in world history did not want to invent God. Let them know once and for all."  
(...)  
"In whom? In Him? Listen, Kirillov stopped, gazing before him with fixed, ecstatic eyes. "Listen to a big idea: There was only one day on earth, and in the middle of the earth stood three crosses. On eon a cross believed so much that he said to another: `This day you will be with me in paradise.' The day ended, they both died, went, and did not find either paradise or resurrection. What had been said would not prove true. Listen: this man was the highest on all the earth, he constituted what it was to live for. Without this man the whole planet with everything on it is­ madness only. There has not been one like Him before or since, not ever, even to the point of miracle. This is the miracle, that there has not been and never will be such a one. And if so, if the laws of nature did not pity even This One, did not pity even their own miracle, but made Him, too, live amidst a lie and die for a lie, then the whole planet is a lie, and stands upon a lie and a stupid mockery. Then the very laws of the planet are a lie and a devil's vaudeville. Why live then, answer me, if you're a man."
