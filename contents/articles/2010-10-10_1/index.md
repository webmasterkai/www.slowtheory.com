I've been having a great time on sunday rides the past couple months. Jeff has made a strong late season surge and I've been trying to periodically get new people out for rides. The past two weeks we've done rides out to the Afton area. Two weeks ago we managed to convince A-train to get out for his longest ride of the year. I rode my singlespeed with a very low gear and the ride was generally *tranquilo*. It was nice. Jeff and I had a chance to chat quite a bit and A-train seemed to enjoy himself more than he typically does on long road rides. The colors were amazing (see photos a few posts ago) and the day could not have had more beautiful weather.  
  
Early in the week Jeff and I decided to do the same route again this week. After failed attempts to entice a number of friends, I extended the invitation to the Veloviet cycling team. Even with only two days notice the turnout was impressive. I believe there were thirteen riders at the start. A handful were planning on only riding ceremonially for a few miles and then turning around due to other obligations, but it was really cool to see the shop bustling with activity early on a sunday morning. We shed a few riders along the way, but nine of us found our way to afton where we stopped for coffee and snacks. Once again, the colors were splendid and the weather was completely unobjectionable. If anything, it was a bit too *warm* for my tastes. That's a complaint that I can live with in October. A year ago we were preparing for our first snowstorm.  
  
Tandem team cleverly made their own route back to the shop. Seven of us rode along the river. It was absolutely serene looking out across the river. We turned up the steep river road climb. It's one of my new favorite climbs. It kicks and winds sadistically. You turn a blind corner to find that the road continues climbing. It's really beautiful. Granted, it's minnesota and as such doesn't gain more than 300 feet in elevation, but it's still pretty cool. At the top of the hill it became obvious the group was beginning to fragment. The great thing about Veloviet is that no one gets hurt feelings. Each person has his or her own goal and is passionately supportive of the completely different goal of the person riding next to him or her. It's cool. Once we got back to the north side of 94 we split into two groups. Dave, on his longest ride of the year, led a group of three while Jeff fired up the afterburners and paced us home at 24mph so that another member of the group could make it in a timely manner to an afternoon engagement. Overall it was just a really pleasant ride. Everyone seemed happy and pleased with the route/logistics.
