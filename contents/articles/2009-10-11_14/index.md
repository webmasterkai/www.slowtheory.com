lately I feel like if I stop moving and just listen no matter where I am I can hear a clock ticking I am on the couch figurative blood crusted on my earlobe from savage clock hands the same eight second audio loop repeated until exhaustion (manifesto) later dream sequence afternoon nap and the acquired smells of meat on the grill two hand one hand showering in the imaginary dark I I ummmm later watching through our strange oneway glass for evidence of my shadow on the couch with bleached brains and book life is easy (she doesn't like me) playing in the dirt playing in dreams I am getting tired now.
