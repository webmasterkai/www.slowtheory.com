![morning coffee](http://f.slowtheory.com/5167099402_8e140e7ebb.jpg "morning coffee")  
  
It was an ordinary morning. I woke up at a predictable time and transitioned from dreaming to waking in a manner consistent with *typical behavior. *I began preparing coffee and then took a shower. By the time I was done showering my space was filled with a rich aroma. My brain activity perked with the promise of its first cup of coffee. Even though I typically have two to three cups of coffee per day, the first remains the life-giver. I waited to put on my glasses until the queasy, sick and disoriented feeling overwhelmed me. When I first began wearing glasses I could live with or without them. my world ebbed and flowed. It was either large and complex or small and mysterious. Lately I have noticed that even thirty minutes without my glasses leaves me feeling quite ill.  
  
Sometime early in the day I received an email from Myst. I have not heard from her since shortly after I returned from Hawaii in early 2009. It began, 

>On 11-11, 2010, one million people across the globe will mentally project a unified vision of a new paradigm for our species... a new reality. The very real physics that connects human consciousness with molecular structure will be harnessed en masse during the largest scale simultaneous manifestation transmission in recorded history." 

The email brought me to <http://www.newrealitytransmission.com>. A strange coincidence, certainly.  
  
For lunch I had a reuben sandwich. I was turned on to the reuben and sauerkraut not more than a few months ago when I had a tempeh reuben sandwich at the Bedlam Theatre.  
  
Presently, I am listening to a Venezuelan guitarist.
