we wanted use our rafts. priority. I had a fun time with alex-em-eff-er stealth camping a week or so ago. fuck. right? so we decided to combine the two into a journey that would take us north of stillwater, into the saint croix and to an island chosen from google investigations. "this looks like an island." so off we went. into the evening. the sun is setting earlier and my mind has grown terrible at keeping things straight. *did he say unconsolable?* fat tires. sort of directionless. sporadic propulsion. occasional sniping. okay. keep it cool fuckers. be friends.

check your egos. nervous energy. endless anxiety and picking at each other's soft spots. what the fuck? fat tires on gravel. fat tires on pave. fat tires in the air. fat tires in the ground.

turning off and flicking on the headlights. flicking off the headlights and screaming into the quarter moon. downhill. uphill. into the city. girls yelling mockingly from their das auto. elongated faux-greet(aunt). the night had grown tiring and the calm water seemed somehow menacing from three hundred feet in the air. lurching downward. boatlaunch. down a flight of stairs. thudthudthud. that's what this shit is for. we looked around. debated. *is this dangerous?* maybe! answered excitedly. apprehensive no longer, "so are we committed?" we were committed. I packed my bike haphazardly on to my boat, not even bothering to take off the rear wheel.

it wasn't far to the island and I didn't want to loosen the rear brake. into the water. the air temperature was dropping rapidly and the strong breeze out of the north was cutting through my limited clothing. I was nervous about going to sleep in wet clothing to temperatures that were working their way towards the mid to low forties. fuck it. the strange visual opposition of the dark outline of our island against the backdrop of an electrically illuminated city of stillwater. I watched the current recede into the darkness. the light ripple across a filthy surface of glass. *I am in love. I am in the dark.* headlamps slowly working their way across the river. we reached a swampy shore, getting out into a pool of slop to the deafening roar of a jungle overrun with insects and amphibians.

it wasn't looking good for my hammock. I packed very little aside from my boat. a hammock, a sleeping

bag and some portable, dry food. nothing fancy. I didn't have a bike set up appropriately for the journey. I unloaded my boat and along with the general headed back to the spot where we'd left em-eff-h:a:w:k, his planetbike superflash a flicking beacon guiding us safely back across the water that now seemed much less intimidating. the plan was that alex would ride in my boat while the general would transport his bike. I'd never transported people or anything heavier than fifty pounds. the boat quickly dropped in the front and felt terrifyingly unstable. nonetheless, I pushed forward, ignoring the terrified look on the face of my boatmate. what? it's not that bad. c'mon. fifty feet from shore we started spinning in a circle. even the slightest paddle stroke would invoke a death spiral. *uh, we should turn back*. even getting back to shore was difficult. new plan: paddle back and bring back an empty boat. once more down the river and back. by this time I was wet and freezing. his bike was safely on the other side, so we enjoyed an unencumbered journey across the water. dim outlines beautifully cast on the unadorned surface. *I am a dreamer*. we were all on the island. success! success? a quick search of the island revealed very few hammock opportunities. the vegetation was dense. very dense. very wet. snakes. spiders. watch where you walk. the ground moved beneath us, an oozing teasing mess. sickening to the touch. across the island I could see the outline of a tree. alex went scouting. his persistence paid off as he found exactly four trees capable of anchoring a hammock--the right amount for the two hammock campers in the group. we hid our shit near the swamp and forged our way through the forest to higher ground. a-train in the bivy. the general in a tent. alex and I in the trees. the short trip had taken us an incredibly long time, so we did little else before crawling into our shelters. I was fairly comfortable in my twenty degree sleeping bag, but I was fearful that the combination of being wet and in the air would result in waking up in the middle of the night freezing. I fell asleep quickly. I slept until 3am. stillwater was asleep. I was pissing, observing her silhouettes and mirrored surfaces. I crawled back into my sleeping bag and went to sleep. the next thing I heard was the a-train's danceparty 2.0 alarm. it was another twenty minutes before I worked up the courage to get out of my sleeping bag. it was fucking cold. forty-four degrees.

perhaps not *fucking*, but for minnesota in august it seemed absurd. packed things. shivered. put on my pfd for the sake of warmth. looked foolish. it was a calm morning and by the time we were on the water the sun was beginning to make things warm. reassemble. say goodbye to the a-train who had better plans: breakfast and a slowdance-car-ride. we began our ascent of myrtle. the street to the sky. I was unobjectionally twenty-tooth. I was happily thirty-four-tooth. dreamily ascending at five m-p-h behind mr. dashfucker and his forty-seven millimeters of outright cheating. we reached the top, turned wide and found ourselves in a beautiful gas station parking lot. "I have to shit." "well I need caffeine." "carrotcake!" (dramatization) it was nice by that time.

I was warm and my feet, though looking a bit like I'd spent five hours in a bathtub were no longer cold. we continued until we reached an unexpected road closure. fuck that. we pressed on, into the dirt. into the sand. through the mud. the general crashed a few times. but he was trying harder, being badder-asser, cognitively disobedient. spunk and earsplitting. hardhats. laughter. principally prized. we played a lot.

I liked it. the ride home was taking a long time, but in a different way. I took a road thinking it was another. g-names. granada, geneva. oops. sidestep instead of backtrack. that's where my navigational mistake occurred. I didn't recognize and/or the crossing didn't exist on the road that we were on. by the time I realized my mistake we'd gone another several miles and were near the other interstate. we made it up from there. inching our way back towards civilization. nothing really went to plan, but it was an amazing time. the weather, aside from being a bit cold, proved to be quite wonderful and our island swamp had a somewhat charming ambiance once I'd worked through its obvious imperfections. the best: no one else was on that piece of land, nor had very many been there recently. because it was shitty? perhaps. but for the night, it was ours. we could watch the seemingly disconnected city lights, with their perfect automation glow and become dim.
