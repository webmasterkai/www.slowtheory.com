Michelle and I participated in the Luminary Loppet last night. It was fun, although a midnight start time with fewer people and an adult theme would be more enjoyable. Either that or just get rid of the skis entirely and make it a party on the lake. These are some not very good photos (I only brought my small, kind of broken point and shoot)
