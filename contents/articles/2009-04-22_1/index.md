I am drawn to her because she is damaged. I always love them more. because they need it. because we are all bound together by an insidious and silent destroyer. yet, the ones in pain are the only ones smart enough to clutch each other, to hold on to their last remnants of humanity. the last things that remain when life starts to go to hell, when there is no money, food, or hope; when we are ravaged by disease, air pollution, and meaninglessness. It is not that we are smarter--though we might be, if only for 'feeling' so acutely--but rather it is that we forgive each other for our mortality. so already I feel sensations for her that I never could for someone who feigns confidence, carries himself with a 'make the best of it' demeanor that transforms and makes tepid those very few things actually worth experiencing. so we drift. we drift into each other from distant places in the cosmos, disaster to disaster, waiting faithfully for our impending supernova, happy only to be part of something so big, so bright, so eternal, even if it means the end of everything else.
