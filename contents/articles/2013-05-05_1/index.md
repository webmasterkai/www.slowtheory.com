Yesterday, I decided that I'd run to Maple Grove to visit my parents. Google suggested a journey of just over seventeen miles, which seemed like the ideal distance for a final long run before a four week stretch that will include The Ice Age 50km, The Almanzo, The Wilder, a trip to the Boundary Waters, and the Chester Woods 50km. 

I woke up stiff and sore as a result of my trip to the gym the previous day. No worries. It would work itself out. I filled my hydration pack, boldly chose a pair of running shorts, and began my journey to the suburbs.

At the end of the Transitway a cyclist complimented my running form. We started talking and I found out that he'd finished the Tour Divide in 2010, is getting ready for Dirty Kanza, runs in Altra shoes, and knows some of the people I know. The endurance junky world is a weird and small place. We ended up run-riding together from the Transitway to Saint Anthony Main. It was a nice distraction.

I continued on Marshall to Broadway, and crossed the river there.

It was much colder than I expected. The high for the day was projected to be 57 degrees, but it felt like it was in the low to mid forties. Since it was early afternoon, it wasn't going to get much warmer.

I meandered through North Minneapolis. I was impressed that not a single person hassled me. Last weekend I ran through the Highland Park area and had at least six people shout things from their car. *Hey, I'm just out for a run.* I don't spend a lot of time in North Minneapolis, but it felt like there was community happening. People were in the streets, walking places.

My planned route was to follow Broadway to Bottineau. This ended up being a bad idea. Bottineau is a highway without any space to run on either side. Fortunately, West Broadway runs parallel and provided a nicer running environment.

As I crossed under 694, I felt like this.

Eventually I found myself back on Bottineau, with about a mile before I could turn west. Since I didn't want to run on the highway, I ran along the railroad tracks. This was great, except that the ground was soft from the recently melted snow.

I turned left on Brooklyn Boulevard, ran past Medtronic and entered the realm of the shopping megaplexes. I felt terrible, but miles 16 and 17 ended up being my fastest. The lesson: mental fortitude is often more relevant than fitness.

I intended to take more photos, but alas, it was cold and I was tired. Next time I journey to the suburbs I will do better.
