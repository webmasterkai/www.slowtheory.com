Since it's our *honeymoon*, we're allowing ourselves the liberty to truncate the distance, but ideally, we do want to maintain the necessary twenty mile per day pace that would allow us to complete the trail in the time that Michelle is able to get off from work. 

I was excited. We too rarely make time to do fun things, even those that don't require a huge investment of time or money. We're too busy being grown-ups and slipping into routine. Note to self: *spend more time together fun-seeking*. We arrived late morning, after poor preparation derailed any plan of arriving early. The people at the park were super friendly, telling us how much they appreciate the Afton trail running event, and going out of their way to make sure we were equipped with the best possible maps for our attempt to replicate the race course. I reasoned that doing one lap would be about the right distance and elevation to simulate a day on the SHT, if only lacking in rocks and roots.

Over the past two months, I've grown spoiled doing much of my running up north. The things that I remembered seemed diminished--smaller, less pristine, and not as challenging. Nevertheless, it was still wonderful. We moved methodically with our 23 pounds packs, which were filled with our seldom used zero degree sleeping bags, snacks, and other gear designed to simulate the weight and volume of our SHT setups. 

It was fun moving slow, chatting, and having nothing else to distract us. We were not buried behind computers or overwhelmed with the endless chores and tasks of trying to keep a household running.

I felt a bit foolish with my gear on the flat prairie sections and occasional gravel road, but I wanted to get accustomed to both carrying weight and using trekking poles. After initial awkwardness, I got used to the poles and found that they helped me to move more fluidly up and down hills. They were certainly overkill for the terrain at Afton, but I think they'll make a world of difference on the SHT. My new Boreas Lost Coast 45L pack performed exceptionally well. I was comfortable, my things were accessible, and the volume is more than adequate for the streamlined load that we intend to carry. It also weighs in as one of the lighter packs available in the 40-45 liter range, with none of the dangling bits that serve only to confuse and irritate me.

Instructions for use: stop, put dried salad in container with water, add water, walk for 20 minutes, sit, eat, and enjoy! It worked great and we enjoyed having a real-food meal. We cut the loop a bit short in the interest of getting Michelle back to her work party in a timely manner, but we still covered 12.8 miles in around 5 hours with stops included. Leisurely, but not ridiculous.

My body felt good. A few aches and pains are lingering from the 50, but nothing too irritating. My toenails didn't bother me, my legs felt fine, and my upper body lasted surprisingly well, given how little I've been using it over the past several months. We had a great time and I walk away feeling much more confident about our ability to exist on the trail two weeks, while moving decisively towards our destination in Duluth.
