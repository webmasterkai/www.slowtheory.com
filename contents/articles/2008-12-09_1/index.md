It was an uncharacteristically busy week for me. Tuesday we had orientation at the coop. "This is the coop," she explained, "and here you will do things." Somehow this explanation took over an hour. Two days later I did my first volunteer shift. Thursday night. It was busy when I arrived. I was assigned the familiar task of stocking shelves. It took a few moments of grappling with the inefficiency of the process to convince myself that I was performing as expected. The items were not divided by area of the store, and there was little space in which to maneuver, often resulting in long journeys with just as much as I could carry in my hands. I soon realized that it didn't really matter. There wasn't that much to do, at least within the confines of what would be expected of me on the first day. The time passed, albeit slowly, and Thursday was over. Woah. Thursday? I worked backwards trying to calculate how I'd even arrived at Thursday. Wednesday I went to work and in the evening went riding with Dave. Aside from a two hour stretch which I spent mostly cleaning the apartment I was gone from morning until night. Monday I worked ten hours and spent another hour and a half on my bike. The rest of Thursday consisted of exercise and panicked trips to the bank to get money for washing my laundry. Winter means that I produce at least twice as much dirty clothing as in the summer. Baselayers, tights, bib shorts, neck gaiters, headbands, gloves, and socks add up quickly. The flurry of activity has left me feeling tired and anti-social.

It's three days later. It has been snowing on and off for a few days. A couple weeks ago I decided that it was finally time to get health insurance. About a year ago I tried the same thing and was told that I would need to undergo a series of expensive and time consuming tests as it's been a rather long time since I've had significant medical treatment or assessment. I didn't have the money at the time for such extravagancies. The peculiar thing was that I was (and still am) in much better condition now than at any time in my life when I've been insured. I'd have been happy to perform a series of physical challenges ala american gladiators. It'd be cheaper and more enjoyable. In any case, this time around to help alleviate the expense I made the difficult decision to sell my Surly Pugsley. Even though I had the most fun riding it, it received the least use and held the highest value of any of my bikes (particularly because of the season), so it had to go. I sold it and sent off my application. Today I received notice that I've been approved and my coverage started a week ago. Awesome!

So instead of the Puglsey I have been riding my karate monkey.
