I spent a substantial amount of time deciding whether or not I would run at all at the Surf the Murph trail run this past Saturday. I had originally signed up for the 50km race, but given the amount of recovery that I needed after Superior, I knew that I wouldn't be doing that distance. The 25km race seemed reasonable. To rekindle some of the excitement intrinsically lost in a distance downgrade, I opted to dress silly for Halloween.

The race started in the dark. I'm glad that I did some googling beforehand, or it wouldn't have occurred to me to bring a headlamp. For the first 45 minutes, we slowly bobbed through the woods by the light of our headlamps. Sunrise was a beautiful thing. The serenity of the woods was profound. By then, the race had spread out enough that it was quite peaceful. The placid lakes began to fill with color and I knew that I made the right decision participating. Trail running really is wonderful.  
  
The first five miles were somewhat technical. It wasn't really the terrain as much as the fact that a thick layer of leaves covered *everything*. A high degree of caution was required descending, as roots and rocks were quick to impede or dangerously accelerate forward progress. After the first aid station, the terrain became much easier. The leaves disappeared and it was flat. I mean, super flat. This remained the theme for the middle portion of the course.  
  
The last part of the course once again proved to be quite challenging. Leaves concealed tricky footing and fall hazards. At one point I kicked a stump and went sliding face first into some slick foliage. This was quite a lot more fun than you might imagine. It reminded me of a slip and slide. I popped back up and scarcely lost a second. Lucky.  
  
I finished with 16.7 miles and felt great. My IT band was a non-issue and aside from being slippery, my Altra Instincts performed marvelously.
