well, the year is done. I've been excited for the past two weeks to start a new spreadsheet for cycling miles. goals for this year: purchase only one new bike during the year and finish the year over 10,000 miles. I finished this year at 8209.51. it's doable. I'm contemplating getting a standard issue specialized tricross (2200 and sora!) in the spring. my fastest geared bike is a pugsley. it'd be nice to have something more suitable for camping. we'll see. I need to pay off the bikes that I already have before I think about that. so, the numbers and a chart:

- December cycling: 607.5 miles (+191.5 from 2008)
- **2009 total: 8209.51 miles (+1870.04 from 2008)**
- Aframe 2819.4
- Pugsley 1413.3
- Brown Monkey 1125.4
- Red Monkey 739.8
- Dummy v2 698.01
- Dummy v1 577.6
- Bianchi 327.5
- Roubaix 174
- Wanta 114.1
- Waterford 112
- Halfway 63
- Raleigh 27.2
- Fisher 18.2

numbers are awesome.
