I am up early again. During the fall I am prone to unpredictable and messy sleep. Each year, I consider the possibilities: too much energy from a reduced work schedule, mild seasonal depression, time-disorientation from the increased darkness, random neurosis, an urgency to fulfill any unfulfilled seasonal desires before the outside world becomes a barren and bitter landscape, or question mark. It could be any or all of these things, or something else entirely. I don't know. I just wake up at random times and move around a lot while I am sleeping. Today I woke up at 6am. The air is cold.  
  
My IT band injury is on the mend. I feel like I can say that definitively now. While I have not subscribed specifically to any one theory explaining either its root or ideal treatment, I think I can narrow my success down to three things:  
  
Blah blah blah. Anyway, it's been good. It has forced me into the unique position of *appreciating* and *respecting* running as an integral piece of one's life. In the past, I have flippantly participated in events, never excelling, but always knowing that I could do the thing and then not do anything for days, weeks, or months before doing the next thing. Now I understand that I must nurture my body's ability to do this thing that I love so much.  
  
Home ownership has left us feeling somewhat isolated. It's not that we don't love it, but it has become some a dominant and overwhelming portion of our life, that it often feels like there is nothing else. For me, it is much less imposing, as I've taken the time to indulge my hobbies and am naturally much more reclusive. However, Michelle has felt disconnected from meaningful community, so we have been brainstorming ideas for ways in which she/we might be able to connect to a new and more immediate community. Volunteering at the Hampden seems to be at the top of the list right now.
