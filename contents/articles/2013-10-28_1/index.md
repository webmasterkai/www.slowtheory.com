![Running at Elm Creek with Bunz](http://slowtheory.trovebox.com/photo/47t/create/1de80/450x450.jpg) 

After spending two weeks getting married, hiking, relaxing, and generally doing anything other than running, it was time to get back at it. On Saturday, Bunda and I attempted to execute the following plan (still oblivious to the fact that when we run together, things never go as planned): ride our bikes to Elm Creek, run 13ish miles, and bike home. It was ambitious, but not *stupid*. Aside from the chilly headwind, it was a pleasant day to ride. Traffic was light to non-existent, the sun was shining, and we'd soon be running some trails. Even when we reached the suburbs and the wind shifted from "mild annoyance" to "brutal obstruction", I didn't mind. I spun a low gear, reminding myself that it would all be worth it on the way home.

We reached the southernmost entrance of the park after a couple hours of riding. Despite having both been to Elm Creek on multiple occasions, we had idea where we'd pick up the singletrack, carelessly maintaining that *wandering* would get us where we needed to be. This should have resonated as being preposterous, but it didn't. We locked up our bikes and began jogging along the horse trails. Running felt difficult. My breathing was labored and I was moving awkwardly. The combination of taking time off and the emergence of cold weather and its required gear made it feel like I was running for the first time. No worries. This was our fun day in the woods. We weren't out to do anything other than enjoy ourselves.

Time passed and we did not find singletrack. As we were walking a short hill (seriously, we were both in pitiful shape), we encountered an acquaintance of mine from the Bicycle Chain. He was out for a stroll on his Salsa Mukluk. I asked him how to get to the singletrack. He offered a rather hopeless expression and told us it was all in the northeast corner of the park, another 3 or 4 miles from where we were. Inexplicably, this did not deter us. We continued our ill-fated northwesterly list, eventually arriving at another incorrect corner of the park. We studied the map and determined that running east and then south wouldn't add much distance, but might allow us to at least set foot on the singletrack.

We had very little food and water. I had a pack of Honey Stinger gel blocks and 40oz. of water. Bunda had nothing. When we reached the parking lot for the mountain bike trails, we were both famished. We split my remaining pack of gelatinous Honey Stinger things and started weaving our way through the singletrack. It was nice to finally be where we intended to be, but I knew that it wasn't going to end well. The run had gotten much longer than anticipated, and 80 calories of sugar was going to buy me, at the most, twenty minutes of energy. 

Eventually we detoured from the singletrack, opting for the most direct route back to our bikes. I had been fine on the trails, but once we were back on the pavement, I was a hopeless. We jogged for a bit, walked for a bit, and repeated until finally we reached the bikes. Our 13ish mile run had turn into 16.3...and frankly, I wasn't even prepared for 13. We dragged ourselves to a Holiday a couple of miles from the park and treated ourselves to a buffet of gas station delicacies including pretzels, clif bars, muffins, and weird fruit cup things. We sat outside, shivering and reflecting on the extremism of the ride. At that moment I would have sworn that I'd never been so tired, hungry, or cold. Once we started moving again, the remainder of the ride home went well. We had a tailwind and traffic was tolerable. I arrived home with just enough time to eat before heading out for the tweed ride. By the end of the day I'd ridden 68 miles and run 16. I was exhausted.
