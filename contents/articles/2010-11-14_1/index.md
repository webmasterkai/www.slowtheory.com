it exists in a particular way, a way representative of the confluence of different ideas and sensations made relevant by the full participation of the two beautiful thinking, feeling things. carrying with me a book half titled *apropos of wet snow* while in my hands holding the pristine, seemingly unaltered coalescence of these complimentary shapes, different enough in texture and constitution to produce contrast but well conceived enough to nurture both unity and autonomy. am I dreaming? *and then it snowed.* just then, wrapped up in the settling memories of the *untouched *city just hours earlier, feet anchored to the earth but mind floating and distilling in that same pervasive way, and *finally*...*finally* speaking without fakevoice and ideahesitancy. the sun setting on the fifth of the twelfth of the november. we stood there as she fumbled with a ring of keys, everything about her anachronistic. the door opened and we entered a room. this room. ordinary things began happening. another group entered, evoking friendly projections and mild mannered *humouristic histrionics. hah ha!* I am in love with the secret workings and understandings. I am in love with the boldness with which you eat your dinner. *I, too, am in love with poetry.* later. ignorantly contemplating molecular structure and the extent to which the human being extends beyond its skinboundaries. this nearly-connected forever HIGH FIVE.
