Earlier this week, I found myself boasting to my roommates about my transcendence beyond petty and generalized illness. The last time I slumped into illness was after my trip to Hawaii with Michelle in 2011. Shortly after that, I adopted a primarily vegan diet and--while occasionally feeling *off* for a day or two--have avoided the routine, lingering illnesses that I formerly suffered once or twice a year. Despite frequent exposure to illness, I cruised happily in my bubble for two years, growing increasingly contented and arrogant in the knowledge that I did not have to worry about a thing that so many others did. Well, life prefers balance, and as my looming immortality threatened upheaval of basic constructs of a fragile existence, life needed to act. So, it did, and I got sick. Except, I pretended that I didn't.

I did not leave for my planned twenty-two mile run until mid-afternoon. The weather was perfect. I thought it might be chilly, but even with temperatures in the twenties, the sun made it feel quite lovely. The first two miles were a mess of re-arranging clothing items, until eventually I achieved a tenuous equilibrium dependent upon pace, clothing configuration, and psychological temperament. I entered a blissful rhythm during which time passed, but I was free from corporality.

I was dislodged from my trance as I neared the end of the River Road. I still had not fully conceded that I was sick, but I now knew that something was off. I felt much more tired than I usually would at that distance. Nonetheless, I made the commitment to cross the river into Mendota. The original route was to run Highway 13 to the Smith high bridge, returning home via Summit Ave. However, I'd forgotten that during the winter the road is obscenely narrow. I was not running with water, so my intention was to first stop at a gas station around mile nine, and then somewhere on Grand around mile 15. Taking the trail would complicate the matter. I considered three options:

- Run past the High Bridge, up Ohio, and stop somewhere on the other side of the river. That meant that my first stop would be around mile 15, and that the total length would balloon to 23.5 or 24 miles.
- Run the trail to Lilydale, up the hill, to the intended gas station, and then continue on the slightly wider section of Highway 13 leading to the High Bridge.
- Run the trail to Lilydale, up the hill, to the intended gas station, and then reverse course.

Instinct told me that I didn't want to run the same course in reverse, but the other two plans seemed unworkable. The thought of no water until mile fifteen, *and* an additional two miles was wholly incompatible with the vague sense of shiftiness that was beginning to creep into my body. As for the other option, despite the fact that Highway 13 gets a bit wider after 35E, one glance north told me that it wasn't for me. So, I stopped for water, decided to simply turn around and run in the opposite direction.

The break lingered on a bit too long. Upon restarting, nausea took hold and only worsened as I ran the false flat of the Big Rivers regional trail. Once I was back on the other side of the river, I conceded that the likelihood of vomiting was high, and that the prudent course of action was to walk until it subsided. Even if that meant walking the last five miles, I was going to do it. It was still beautiful outside, and the sun--now low in the sky--cast the most wonderful shadows and illuminated the world with uncanny warmth. I enjoyed the walk and slowly started feeling better.

Within a mile and a half, I could run again. I was slower than usual, but it didn't matter. I was seventeen miles into a poorly planned, poorly executed, run that was beleaguered by illness and physical incapability. *Character building.* I ran the next three miles before the nausea returned around mile twenty. I walked the final mile to home and delighted in the fact that I now had a skill that I didn't when I left: I could have a terrible day, implode dramatically, while remaining positive and knowing that things would improve. In some ways, it was more valuable than if things had gone well.
