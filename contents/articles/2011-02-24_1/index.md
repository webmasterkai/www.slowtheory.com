**Weather:** around 20 degrees, very little wind, partly cloudy. 
**Distance: **18.7 miles 
**Time: **3h25m  
  
**Notes:** aside from one short run at the gym, I hadn't run since last week's disheartening sixteen mile run. I was not feeling very confident going into an even longer run, with lower temperatures and more difficult running conditions (a foot of snow fell over the weekend). I tried to push it out of my mind and do the things that I could to prepare better. I ate an enormous breakfast in waves: first granola, then bread, then pancakes, and then more granola. I planned for one stop just after mile eleven. this time I decided that stop would be at my apartment and I would allow myself fifteen minutes to discard wet layers, eat, drink, and gather the courage to go outside and run another seven miles.   
  
the other change I made was in my handwear. I sweat a lot and my hands get cold. this time I created a makeshift vapor barrier out of latex gloves. it worked swimmingly (hah ha). a disgusting amount of water accumulated inside of the latex gloves, but my insulating layer remained dry and consequently my hands were toasty warm for the entire run. I didn't have to resort to swinging my arms wildly or doing pushups. awesome!  
  
the first part of the run to my apartment went almost suspiciously easy. even three miles away from home I was thinking about how to make my stop efficient, which clothing needed to be changed and what I might be able to eat that wouldn't result in immediately keeling over with abdominal cramps once I'd started running again. once I got there, I efficiently discarded my upper baselayer, put some shea butter on my bloody nipples, drank naked juice and water until I felt vaguely ill, retied my shoes and headed out the door. thirteen minutes. perfect.  
  
the next three miles were easy. around mile fifteen I started to feel tired. *just keep running,* I kept telling myself. and I did. then I was home. 18.7 miles. that's longer than any training run I did in preparation for grandma's 2008. probably only one more long run and then it'll be time to do what I do best: taper.
