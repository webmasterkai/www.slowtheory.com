Well, I didn't get into transiowa. It's a 300+ mile day and a half long race across the ill maintained secondary dirt roads of iowa. Only the first seventy-five entrants were allowed, and newcomers were not allowed to enter until after everyone who has done it before had their shot. My postcard never had a chance. I'm surprised how disappointed I am that I didn't make the cut. I'm not sure if I have the fitness or confidence to finish such a long, grueling race, but I really wanted to try. I was counting on it being my motivation to get outside during these cold months. Now there is little. Yesterday's long commute through fierce winds and on heavily salted roads now seems almost pointless. There's some level of self satisfaction to be gained from such an endeavor, but how far will that take me? My winter bicycling mileage has generally sucked, and this year will likely be no different. I'll definitely have no reason to get on the trainer and will have to ignore all manner of logic to leave progressively earlier for work in order to extend my commute sixfold. Yeah, I'm bummed.
