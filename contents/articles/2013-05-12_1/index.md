Even though the Ice Age 50km was on my calendar for several months, I found myself trying to concoct a plan for the weekend just days before the race. The original, though poorly developed, idea was that we would visit Michelle's sister in Madison and make a mini-vacation out of it. I failed to get Sunday off from work, while she similarly failed to free her Friday. Suddenly, the weekend was compacted into a frenzy of driving and running. Because of this, I decided to rent a car and embark on a solo road trip…one that put me in the driver's seat for the first time since 2009.

Early Friday morning I ran to a nearby Avis to pick up my rental car. I slipped into the pilot's chair. Soon the behemoth lurched forward as I tried to reawaken the dormant pedal-actuation muscles. Eventually I got the hang of it and found myself heading east on I-94. I positioned myself in the middle lane and drove the same speed as the car in front of me. About an hour outside of Minneapolis, traffic thinned and I was able to relax, scanning the radio for anything that might amuse, entertain, or inspire. Nothing. The five hour journey to Fort Atkinson promised, and subsequently delivered, boredom.

I arrived in the afternoon. Fort Atkinson and Whitewater were striking in that they were much more collegetown than backwoods Wisconsin. Bike lanes lined the streets, and a lively downtown exuded a youthful and progressive ambiance. On the edge of town there was a dirty motel called the Villa Inn that offered $40/night room rental. The haze from the heavily perfumed, toxic scents almost succeeded in drawing attention from the fact that the walls were cracking, the sheets were dirty, and vacant space occupied the positions where there should have been desks, chairs, and Bob Ross paintings.

It was fine. I grew accustomed to the dizzying odors, watched TV on my computer, and went to sleep.

I woke up at 6:20am. I ate bagels, drank coffee, installed my timing chip on my shoe, checked the weather, changed clothing layers ten or twelve times, and brushed my teeth. One hour later I checked out of the motel and drove 25 minutes to the race start. I miraculously found a parking spot, walked to the starting line, and waited, shivering. 

The normal pre-race stuff happened--people cheered, the rain stopped, the sun poked through the clouds, and our collective inspiration elicited the occasional whooping. Great. The race started. My goal was simple: run even splits, finish strong, and build confidence for the season's longer races. The first section was an out-and-back on singletrack. I'm not generally a fan of out and back sections, but this one was nice. It wound decisively through pine forests, undulating with just enough sincerity that my tired, heavy legs woke up and I started feeling good.

Around mile seven I caught up to a woman. It was an awkward spot to pass, so I made conversation. "How is your day going?" I asked. We'd spend the next sixteen miles running together. I learned that she won the race in 2005 before becoming a Mom and realigning her priorities. We talked about many other things during the next 2.5 hours, but most importantly, we had friendship and camaraderie. Sometimes I enjoy the isolation of running races alone, but on this day I was extremely grateful to have a partner. As an added bonus, she knew the course well and could tell me what to expect from the remainder of the race. 

Around mile thirteen, we began our first of two nine mile loops on the ski trails. Switching from tight singletrack to ski trail was initially disappointing, but soon the flat ski trail became rolling and steep. I liked this. I felt good, I was keeping up with hydration, and the steady diet of aid station bananas seemed to be providing all of the calories that I needed.

Just after the start of the second lap, my running pal began struggling with fatigue and cramps. I felt good, so I wished her luck and continued on my way, intent on performing better from miles 25 to 30 than I had at the Trail Mix. I focused on not going too hard, settling on a pace just slightly faster than I'd run the previous lap.

The rest of the race went extraordinarily well. I ate occasionally, did not feel nauseous at any point, and logged my third fastest mile at mile 29 and my sixth fastest at mile 30. It felt great to end the race on a high note.

I was happy to be feeling so good, because I had a five hour drive ahead of me. I enjoyed some post run food and set out on my journey home. Aside from a few rain showers and a stiff wind, it also went exceptionally well. I pulled into my driveway just before sunset.
