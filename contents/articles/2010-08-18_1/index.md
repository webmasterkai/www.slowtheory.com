![we <3 mom](http://f.slowtheory.com/4904508342_faefd3d215.jpg "we <3 mom")  
  
I was feeling sad yesterday. in one of my more punk rock moments in recent history I decided that rather than stay home and indulge my despair, we were going to go out and *party*. the original plan was bryant lake bowl. it was closed for routine maintenance. I flirted with despair again, but fuck that: I was going to have fun. I was going to laugh, listen to wonderful stories, and stagger drunkenly around the grocery store at 2am. I did just that.  
  
it was a good night.
