After two weeks of feeling awful, I finally had a good run today. I didn't run particularly long or hard, but I could feel the building blocks slipping into place. I have become accustomed to the ebb and flow. Last week's recap:

**Monday:** 9.2 miles (1h22m). Ran in my Trail Roc 255s to the river, sticking primarily to the gravel along the railroad tracks. Kept dirt-hunting, made a silly loop near the Plymouth bridge, and returned the way that I had come. Slow pace, felt terrible, and made a poor choice in footwear. I love the Trail Roc for actual trail running, but on pavement it is way too minimal.

**Thursday:** 5.4 miles (45m). Took two days off and ran in Hokas to try to keep the trajectory going towards *healthy*. Didn't really work. Michelle locked her keys in her car, so I ran to the Bettys office, hitting a couple good hills along the route. Difficulty breathing, generally lethargic, but was able to run a bit faster with no additional discomfort.

**Saturday:** 8.6 miles (1h16m). Felt decent. Did a loop to the river, up towards Como, through the golf course, and home via Raymond. Felt *medium*.

**Sunday:** 7.9 miles (1h10m). Felt pretty good. Highlight of the ride was stumbling across a group of hipsters on the Switchback hill off the railroad service road getting rad on skateboards.

I plan to run again tomorrow, and a very short run on Wednesday, then it'll be rest-rest-rest until the Afton 50km on Saturday.
