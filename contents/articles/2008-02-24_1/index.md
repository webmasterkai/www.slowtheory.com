Today marked our first pugsley group ride since Matt bought his a week ago. The group consisted of only three people and two pugsleys.

In spite of the availability of a third pugsley, the general opted to ride his regular mountain bike with narrow rims and a 2.4 tire. After stopping at the coop for food supplies we headed down the greenway. It was uneventful except for this bike with a sidecar that was inexplicably attached to the roof of a car. We continued riding until we reached Lake of the Isles, where we exited the trail and started riding on the lake.

Snow conditions were pretty good, but the general struggled with his comparatively narrow tires. It couldn't have helped that he was running them at about 150psi. I think he must own a track pump.

We followed a few lakes until we were at Theodore Wirth. After one loop the general called for a ride and Matt and I headed back the way that we came.

The ride home was boring, but the weather was absolutely fantastic and it was just nice to be outside.
