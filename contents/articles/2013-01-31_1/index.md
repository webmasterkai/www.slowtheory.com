I remember winter. It had a decided temperament. Initially, I would resist its rigid and imposing behavior. *I want it to be warmer,* I would explain. It would not listen. *Please, I want it to snow less.* Winter would only cruelly tempt me with enchanting blue skies that lured me from the safety and warmth of my home, only to find that the outside world was as inhospitable as I had remembered it. Finally, we would settle into it, our bad relationship defining the moments of my life every November through March.

Something changed. Winter became unpredictable. I would mutter, *Winter, I feel like I don't even know you anymore.* It wasn't that I wanted it to be cold…or snowy…or inhospitable. I just wanted to know that Winter felt at liberty to be itself. *Winter, I didn't mean to change you. You were beautiful.* I tried to recall the unhealthy dynamic that we'd developed. I tried not to be completely in love with the retrojected ideal that I had imposed on our relationship.

But I failed. I am still in love with winter. I want it back. I don't want it to be forty degrees and rainy. I don't want to compress my adoration for it into the small space of this moment, when for the first time in a long time, my friend, my love, my winter, is the thing that it wants and needs to be.
