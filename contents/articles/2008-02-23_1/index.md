The weather today was gorgeous. Since I had the day off we decided to bump our usual Sunday road ride ahead a day and set off down the transitway toward the river road at noon. The sky was a brilliant shade of blue, marred by not even a single cloud. 

I should have prefaced this blog post by saying that in the past week I've decided something: I like blogs with pictures. As such, my year long debate as to whether I should get a digital slr camera or something small and durable, but without the quality and artistic merit of an slr. I opted for the latter. Someday when I have a grip of extra cash I'll own both, but for the time I think utility will trump art. In any case, my blog will now have pictures. C lick on the small version to see the big version, if you're so inclined. 

We continued down the river road. There was something fresh and springlike in the air. Lately it has seemed merely vacant, as if I am existing against all odds in a vacuum.

At the end of the river road I was sure that I wasn't ready to go home. On the other side of the river the path that we normally take remains unplowed for the duration of the winter. Hence, we normally avoid that side of the river in the winter. Today we went across the river anyway, settled that if the path was unplowed, as it was certain to be, we would just take the highway that runs parallel to it until we could rejoin Lilydale road. Traffic was somewhat irritating but we made it through unscathed. 

On Lilydale road we stopped briefly at one of the ice slides that seem to form every year.

After riding up and down the Mounds Park hill we decided to go north and find out where the Bruce Vento trail actually goes. It's such a useless trail that I've never found the occasion to ride on it for more than a quarter mile. Perhaps it is useful to people who work in downtown Saint Paul. I hope so anyway as it's one of the better maintained trails in the Twin Cities area (almost on par with the greenway). 

We followed the trail to its anti-climactic end near the Vadnais Heights water tower. We turned around and rode back to County Road C where Jeff went one direction and I went the other. The light changed at Highway 61 and I watched a car run into the back of a van. It was accompanied by the sound of hollow plastic contorting until the metal pieces made contact with a large thud. Even having witnessed the accident from start to finish I could not have speculated on what happened. The road was free of ice and neither vehicle was traveling particularly fast or maneuvering abruptly. The one vehicle simply ran into the other vehicle. The rest of the ride home was uneventful except for the gangster girl and guy at the bus stop who kept saying bitch really loud. It was about halfway up the Arlington hill so I wasn't traveling very fast. They must have each said bitch about ten times while I was within earshot. I think there were other words in between but it was difficult to tell.
