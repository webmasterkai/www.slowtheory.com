Oh, ephemeral plaything  
pretty waxen figurine of my mind's dereliction  
I sin for you in the most insidious and awful ways  
our language evocatively stoking our continuity  
and always The next time we meet  
you are not the same  
but my frenzied mind does not care  
conceding its other discourses of religion  
to an endless sea on which we are both  
lost and fulfilled  
our tentacles abiding by the rules  
that in the end we will kill each other  
and that death  
is what we accept  
when we are joined as one
