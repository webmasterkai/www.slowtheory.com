After taking some time off, Jeff and I decided to get Sunday rides rolling again. It was snowing as we departed. Large, dry and lingering, the optical density made the weather channel's description of "light snow" seem rather inaccurate. Nevertheless, we moved forward. The route was designed to take advantage of the extensive network of trails on the Minneapolis side of the river, thereby avoiding the dangers of automobiles. As we sat stopped at a light in Dinkytown a police car pulled in our path and rolled down his window. My mind quickly scanned through a list of possible crimes we might have committed. My front wheel overlapped with the crosswalk by about two inches, but aside from that our actions seemed well within the confines of the law. Fortunately, he just wanted to talk to Jeff about his Pugsley. I was surprised as I tend to lump non-cyclists all into the same category as unobservant and malicious. He was genuinely interested, writing down both my name and our shop name. My next surprise will be when he doesn't balk at the price. Snow bikes are expensive.

Once across the river we followed 2nd under the freeway to Victory Memorial Parkway. I love Minneapolis. Even though 2nd is not a heavily traveled road, it was plowed to the curb which happily included the bike lane. Are you fucking kidding me? The bike lane? Yeah, seriously. Even Summit, arguably the most bicycle dense road in Saint Paul, is a rutted and icy mess. Not the case in Minneapolis. From here we rode the trails until we reached Theodore Wirth. Since Jeff had his Pugsley, I offered to reward him with a bit of genuine offroad snow riding. The trail was fairly tricky. I'm not sure if it's because last time I rode it I was also on a Pugsley, or if it was actually in worse condition, but I had a difficult time for the first bit of it. I continued to take air out of my tires until they must have been between 8-10psi. On a regular mountain bike rim it's often dangerous territory to ride with so little pressure, but on this occasion it worked great. Riding became much easier and the laborious task became a lot more fun. Around this time the sun made a brief appearance. Nice.

After our brief detour we continued along the Lakes to the Cedar Lake trail and then connected to the Greenway. Over the first thirty miles we were in bike lanes or on trails for all of it except for perhaps a mile between the transitway and the bike lane on fifth. It provided a very pleasant experience in which we didn't have to worry about getting run over. This changed as we exited the Greenway for the final six miles. Almost immediately after re-entering the roadway a car passed within a few precious inches of my elbow. After offering a mitten clad gesture that could have been interpreted in a number of different ways, I noticed that they were rocking a bumper sticker that read, "got freedom?" 'No,' I muttered, 'because the freedom of driving your car like a homicidal moron has imposed on it.' Of course, no one heard this and the subtle irony was a gift given only to Jeff and I.

The rest of the ride home wasn't very much fun, and after cramming a lot of exercise into the last few days I was about ready to tip over from fatigue. I didn't envy Jeff's additional twelve mile ride on either end of our ride.
