I'm beginning to piece together my "race schedule" for 2014. Obviously, the *big dance* is once again going to be on the SHT. I'll be stepping up from the 50 mile distance to the 100. Despite gaining a lot of confidence from this year's race, I still feel compelled to include one 50+ mile race in next year's plan, ideally somewhere between April and June. I began by researching my local options.

First, I considered **Zumbro**, but ruled it out for a very good reason--Jason will be making his first attempt at a 100 miler, and I want to be there to support him. Furthermore, I don't *love* running loops and it's mostly run during the night. Sure, I'll have to run at night during Superior, but there will be pacers and I'll be moving much slower. I then considered **Ice Age**. I ran the 50k last year, and despite not loving the course, it was pleasant enough to attract my interest. Plus, the additional distance is run on the interesting part of the course. However, I soon realized that I have to attend on a wedding on that day. Finally, I considered the **Black Hills 50**. I gave this one serious thought, but ultimately decided that if I was going to travel 10 hours, I might as well do something a little bit less familiar.

So, I began searching for races in the western part of the United States, where mountain races seem to happen on a weekly basis. I paid particular attention to beauty, difficulty, remoteness, elevation, and point to point versus out and back. After comparing many different races, I settled on the [Bryce 50](http://ultrasignup.com/register.aspx?did=24358). I've read a few race reports from the 100 mile version, and it seems like just the thing that I want--a point to point course that is brutally slow and difficult, in an area of the world that looks both inspiring and unfamiliar. I still need to get over the unknown of running at altitude, and the feeling of terror that accompanies such unfamiliarity and remoteness, but I'm excited to do it.

So, my tentative races for the year will be:

- Winter Wilder in January
- Trail Mix in April
- Wilder or Superior 50k in May
- Bryce 50 mile in June
- Eugene Curnow trail marathon in July
- Superior 100 in September

That's it. The rest will be *training*. I'll definitely try to get on the SHT at least a few times with friends.
