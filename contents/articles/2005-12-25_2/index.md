excerpts from my notebook:

> I saw her this morning. there is something magical about the way that she moves. it is graceful, but not so graceful as to seem fragile; it is inelegant, but not so inelegant as to seem bawdy or cumbersome. it is beautiful, delicate, and human. i love being alone in the breakroom, writing my splintered thoughts that aren't as clever, cryptic, or intelligent as the ones that i formulate behind the computer ...there are many people who seem beautiful from far away but very few of them maintain that same hailed perfection on further investigation. she is different. i thought so when i met her--there is something perfect in that face ...the way that it smiles, its color, its texture--it is the face of an angel and a voice of irrational melodies.

#### day fourteen

> an arbitrary beginning to a specific delegation of myself into what can be, even now, only surreal dream landscape. there is something cute and jangly about the way that she walks, as though she's always inviting me to roll around with her on the ground. i like her laugh--always ready at a moment's notice and accompanied by the perfect arrangement of her face. they'll say i'm demented. i ruined my name at roseville by thinking i could have a taste of that once thought beauty . this is different though(again). this time and this face are a shade of perfect that i've not known. it is so perfect because i will not know it. i scarcely let myself recognize the fact that she will either never know or she will know and it will be ruined as if i could really tell here! and what then? what is she said something other than "by god you're fucking mad!" what will i learn reading my journals of the past years? will i learn anything? have i grown, changed, or only shrunk? solutions seemed so obvious and they have solved nothing. i'm old. bitter cracking and withholding humanity. i am stripped of faculty and my pen falls weakly on the page.

#### day fifteen 

> i agreed to work a seventeen hour shift on new year's just to get my mind off of things. she's not here today. it makes me nervous everyday that i don't see her, knowing that she is already changing. she will move away or get married and soon she won't be there for dreaming, only then despairing. last night i tried to stay up to finish my paper. i fell asleep and, as has become my custom, i did not get up until the last possible moment. it rained last night. a week of bitter cold was replaced by warm weather and treacherous roads. this winter has been like a terrible arctic expedition. it finds new ways to be dis...carolyn just walked in. i think we're friends now. it took her forever. up in the sky...it's my dead hand!
