A few interesting things happened this evening. First, I drank beer that came from a corked bottle. I may have done this before in my life, but I don't recall it if I have. Next, I ate antelope. It was enjoyable. Tender. It must have been lazy antelope. And finally, I broke a pedal with several miles remaining on my trip home. This meant that I had to essentially ride one legged since my wet boot slipped off the broken nub when I applied any force. I averaged about 8mph.

"Pablo Picasso never got called an asshole. Not like you." I had this dream last night. Imagine. "Talking in a car." She asked me to put my hand on her pregnant midsection. Beautiful. "Girls could not resist the stare." This girl looked beautiful, and the truth was that we'd never see each other again. I told her this. White shirt, perfectly formed and somehow beautiful. "And here's your chance to make me feel awkward...I saw you though today..." She was leaving. Montana or something. I couldn't figure out what to do with my hand. It lingered on her stomach. And somehow she was in denial, thinking that it mattered whether or not we'd see each other again. Looking through doubled up glass doors. "My telephone never rings...I hate myself today...but I can see through this bitterness and sadness." Turned on the music player. "I won't die." Part two involves something else. "Hey honey, are you just posting lyrics from your I-POD?" "Fuck off. She cracked. I won. I'm hurt. You're right.

Later in the day I looked up the word "pelargonium" in the dictionary, thinking that it was illicit. Nope. Flowers. "I can't stand what you do. I'm in love with your eyes." A kaleidoscope, right? Later in the day I spent time scrutinizing the ingredients in various baked goods. Cookbook was the first thing I ever googled, before even my own name or pornography. "You live in modern apartments." "Last time I walked down your street there were tears in my eyes." There was an opportunity for the coopted ideas to lose their sincerity amidst a presumably beautiful world of lovely pregnancies and little girl minds. Nose ring. Classic 1999. I once tried to come up with an algorithm for my personal relationships based on the three digit code on Levi jeans. "So when you get out of the hospital, let me back into your life."

Discretionary jumping jacks. Etc. Coffee beans. It's marvelous. Last night I had a dream in which I attempted to copy and paste the text of the dream into my waking life.
