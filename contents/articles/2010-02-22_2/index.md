late february. I have started running again. thursday I went for an eight mile run around lake of the isles. it was fantastic. I felt great, the sun was shining and the snow was melting beneath my feet. it was superb. I was not particularly fast, but since I haven't been running regularly I was pleased with the effort.

saturday was frostbike. dave and I both decided to ride. my route there took me down portland where I met dave in bloomington. we then headed west to qbp headquarters. after scoping out new bike things (salsa bottle cages that will hold tube shaped objects like sleeping mats or nalgenes highlighted my experience) I decided that I'd ride to saint paul with dave before heading home. as we headed east I realized that we had a substantial tailwind. our speeds ranged between 17-23mph. it was an exhilarating ride that reminded me of the difference between riding in the summer and the winter. I slightly regretted riding studded tires. we stopped at fort snelling for a free energy bar break. it's probably the best ride that I've had this year. I finished at fifty miles for the day, but it felt like the equivalent of twenty pugsley miles.

sunday: more running and a shorter ride with ryan.
