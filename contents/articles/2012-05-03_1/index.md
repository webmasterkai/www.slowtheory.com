Sometimes I wonder how multi-sport athletes find balance. Although most of the events I'm entering this year do not even register on *real* race calendars, they are significant to me. On May 19th, I'll be lining up at the Almanzo 100. Two weeks after that I am signed up for the Minneapolis marathon. I've struggled to find balance in my training for these two events. Instinct and aptitude tell me that I want to ride my bike, but the visceral satisfaction of running combined with the greater need for practice suggest I should be doing that.  
  
So, I sort of do both. Thursday I went out for a long'ish run. Most of my running recently has been very short, so the 10.5 miles registered as *uhhh..kind of hard.* I was slower than anticipated, and suffered a higher degree of achiness the following day. In fact, when I decided to join Bryce, Graham, and Bill on a Sunday morning ride, I was still feeling the effects of my oh-so-unimpressive Thursday run. This did not stop me from trying to win the first half of the ride. However, by the time we reached Afton I knew that it was not my day. I played it cool and followed Bryce as he impressively pounded out the miles. I survived without the shame of getting dropped, but only by a fraction.  
  
After work it was time for Shop BBQ, redux. The spread of food was again impressive, and attendance peaked at 80%+. Good, very good.
