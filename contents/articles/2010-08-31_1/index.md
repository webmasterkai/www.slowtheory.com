August was a pretty good month for cycling. I tried to push myself mentally. Early in the month we did a quick overnight trip to the snake river campground. Just a couple days ago Jeff and I took a one day trip to Duluth. These trips were both challenging for different reasons. Waking up after camping, facing a 90 mile ride home forced me to focus on the moment. *Yeah, I'm several hours from home, the wind is in my face, and I haven't eaten breakfast.* The ride to Duluth was about endurance, saddle time, and the ability to deconceptualize distance. I need to improve a lot before the tour divide, but I'm headed in the right direction.
