i am not a part of the days that i have been living. brush my teeth. dangle a towel over my right shoulder and grab it with my left hand. a dream of giving. i am not sure what it means to wait for a phone call. tap my fingers against molded plastic. read a book and contemplate different types of silence. do i want music? do i want television? do i want the hum of a fan? or only to mumble to myself? wash my dishes. put my trash next to the door and think to myself, "i don’t want to open the door; who is that in the hallway?" i receive a letter--"despair not, you’ll see how it all pans out...MK"

it doesn’t matter what time the clock says. it’s eleven o’clock at three o’clock and twelve o’clock at nine fifty-seven. it’s one fifteen at three oh nine and it doesn’t matter. a dream fallen from the sky. language taught me to lie and fidget. i have no language for an empty room. 

...i just noticed that we have matching stigmata. our fingers almost touch while we pick up plastic wall mounts. mine and yours, darting carelessly between each other. i wonder what you think when you watch me move. i am best at watching. i am best at not being a part of anything. when our fingers threaten to touch my voice trails off and my breath comes in gasps. delighted and petrified. amused and awakened. delirious and desirous. like skirting death more than twice. or waking up with a divine notice that today i won’t be revived. turn the stove to four twenty five. shuffle through the mail. grasp it with my left hand and pull with the right. cough into my shoulder. 

i look at my body. 

other bodies frighten me. next to mine. far away or trembling. soft skin is miraculous. run a finger over my knuckles and the awful shade of pink-white- dry. it looks so warm from three feet away. it looks so pleasant from my eye to my hand. not mine. the awful flakes and molten rumblings. it’s the twenty-first century. it’s the third hour. it’s the thirteenth day. it’s the two thousand or one millionth year. it’s twenty-five years since...when they’re far away i want them to move slowly over my 

body.

how to touch a body? how to move, feel, and speak with touch? my body listens and what has it heard? "i am not sure of you." "i am not near to you." "i do not trust you." "i’m not sure how to speak with my body." "i do not deserve bliss." "there will be no subtlety."

i contemplate my organs.

my feet are very sensitive to touch.

my hands and my head. my fingers are crooked.

i am endowed with

a body.

and flesh.

i need.
