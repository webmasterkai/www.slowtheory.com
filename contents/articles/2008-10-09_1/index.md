Yesterday we gathered after work for the second weekly longbike ride. I was tired and it was windy so the first part of the ride has been completely erased from my memory. Once the sun went down and we were on the other side of the river things became more interesting. There was a tic-tic coming from the back of my bike which turned into an outright flat at the bottom of the ohio street hill. A team effort got me rolling again, but a hatred of mini-pumps and a general sense of laziness left me with only 15psi in my tire. I checked it when I got home. It explained why everything was suddenly much more difficult. We stopped at a bar and a quick survey found that two out of every three people were insane. A crackhead came up to our table and in piercing monologue covered such diverse topics as "the president", presidents in general, biggie, tupac, and what it means to be gangster. He asked that we keep these priceless bits to ourselves, so I won't delve further into the specifics (also, I only understood every fourth word and spent most of the conversation acquainting myself with the location of nearby objects that could serve as a weapon). I rode home, slowly, painfully, and went to sleep.

This morning I set out for a trail near Fort snelling that Dave pointed out to me the previous night. It's amazing to me that after riding thousands of miles with a twenty mile radius I can still find new things. It was a beautiful morning. The trail was about eight miles in each direction and almost completely removed from traffic and people. I saw one person on the way out and two people and two dogs on the return trip.
