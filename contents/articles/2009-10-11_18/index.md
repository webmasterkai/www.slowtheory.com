wake up late, seemingly later. eight-something. disoriented. nightmares. I went to sleep uneasy and maintained it through the night. I felt like I was turning myself inside out. the gentle hum of the window air conditioner. a washing machine. I can't remember anything from my sleep other than faces. expressions. sometimes hateful and other times indifferent. life with its uniqueness tipped towards either extreme. guess. impose solution in the face of no question whatsoever. fuck that. fuck cognizance and the blessing of self awareness. finding happiness. day off. blog write pictures run comment on the wind. nights awkward posture on the sitting couch. look at the light as it strays through our windows and into our dreams. this is a magnificent tuna sandwich, an achievement of will versus matter. just look at it.

yesterday: the dog's name was clark kent. a blind man's dog as far as I could tell. it wore a pocketed vest full of information and behaved like a perfect gentleman, dropping out of character only briefly to shake its head back and forth. the sound of its slapping ears the only recognizable evidence of doghood (godhood). I talked to the man like any other man. let him test bicycles. buy bicycles. ride off on bicycles. weird. the dog's name was clark kent. it's been decided that when we get a dog it will be named clark kent. the world is hilarious enough for two dogs with such a name.

went running. on the ski trails. secretly. up and down. through the inner city woods. it was beautiful. using my legs in new ways. running. bounding. childlike and mischievous. ha ha. a source of amusement to myself. ever bending my eyes around the edges of mixed reality and the energy of the brain. longer, fitter, faster. unintentionally thinner. not unokay. bounding through the words, alleviating the present madness of confused uniformity. experientially, undifferent. indifferent. classified alternatives. oh bliss. oh gross.

it will be my third marathon. the third in three years. I wonder if I will escape from them at some point? artificial induction/conduction of purpose. manipulating the strands of everyday. pointing to the sky and concocting dreams. yet something more simple in this. something comprised of love and compassion.

hello darling. explicate/extrapolate for a moment. the delicacy of our inside out shapes. cavorting with the shadows. chocolate in my coffee. times. things. the owl clock on the wall. changing shifting. becoming but a single shape. endless and boundless. through the woods and back into the night.
