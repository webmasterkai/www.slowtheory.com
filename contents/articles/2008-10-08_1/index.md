I went to the grocery store while it was raining this morning. It was stupid since I had the entire day free and could have just as easily gone in the afternoon. Because of this I was hypersensitive to the small things that generally only bother me as sensations rather than ideas. This uncommon level of self awareness seemed rare insight, so here it is: a man in the bread aisle handling a loaf of bread as though it were the geological find of the millennium. His points of contact awkwardly balanced between not having touched it at all and cradling it like a precious newborn. It's fucking bread. I think there have only been two or three times in my life when a piece of bread was so mangled that it would not make an adequate sandwich, or perform any other conceivable task of a piece of bread. Later it occurred to me that when a cereal comes in three very similar container sizes I always buy whichever is least expensive. I hate that there are three sizes of raisin bran that deviate by no more than 30% in volume.

About ten days ago I slept three consecutive nights without waking until morning. I had not done this since the spring and have not done it again in the past several days. Was it spiritual contentment, dietary, or merely a coincidence of anti-noises? Last night I woke up at least once to stomping. Most of the sounds here are either music or yelling. Stomping was new. I didn't like it at all. Later there was yelling. This is the noisiest place I have ever lived.

The mornings are cold now. Shorts have become tights, and the imposing darkness makes the last hours of the day meaningless, exercise in the willpower of sitting quietly through the mundane. I spend my days sharpening skates and listening to the various permutations of the automatic hum of harnessed electricity. The radio dial mocks me. Always as though eyes were on me. The sun still in the sky at 8:30pm. Watching. Ungrateful. And now a certain type of isolation that at times can seem refreshing, as though the weight of being perpetual y observed by the judgmental has suddenly lifted. Free forever to stoop and dream and slash at my wrists with words. Next week I am leaving town to drown myself in fall colors and starlight.

It is morning.
