It was the first really fucking cold morning of the year. When I got to work the temperature was 5 degrees with a northwest wind that made it feel like -10. I saw one other cyclist on my trip in to work. I watched her approach from the opposite direction. She noticed me at the last moment, jerking her head wildly from the prison of her many layers. Winter is a lonely time to ride a bicycle. It is the time of year when there seems to be no shame in sharing eye contact. Perhaps it is the vacancy with which the chilled heap of flesh stares, like meat hanging from a hook at the butcher's shop. After a mile my right hand had grown numb, even with gloves claimed to endure zero degrees fahrenheit and handlebar mitts. I had difficulty breathing. I moved my fingers of my right hand like I was trying to play the piano. There were two men delivering newspapers on foot. 

I need to start getting ready for grandma's. I've gained ten pounds--­about one pound every five days­--since the marathon in october. My eating habits have been very poor and I have not been exercising as much as I should. I am not surprised by this as I was rather burned out on training and needed some time to regain my focus and ambition. I am a very habitual person. When I have good habits they are not at all difficult to maintain. Unfortunately this is also true of bad habits. So I will make a list of goals that I hope to achieve or maintain: fewer calories­--this is huge as my body feels the need to eat when it's cold; run at least three times a week, even if it's not far; avoid things above 60 on the glycemic index; eat less in the hours before bed; fewer carbohydrates; drop eight pounds by the first of the year; and find a new winter hobby.
