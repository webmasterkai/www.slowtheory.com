Time to divert my attention from serious, important things to talk about *stuff*. This is a list of ten things that I liked in 2010 pertaining (sometimes loosely) to bicycles in no specific order.  
  
**E3 supernova pro headlight.** I bought this light in the early summer to have on my *always ready to go commuter*. It had been a couple years since I had dabbled in generator lights and I was utterly astounded by how much the technology improved. It's very bright, has a nice beam, is flicker-free, has a stand light, and comes with a sturdy mount and excellent light housing. I primarily used this as a commuter light, but on a late night trip to Wisconsin I used this as my primary light. It was great being able to ride into the night without any concern about battery life. Even on the highway at 20+mph I had enough light to feel comfortable. Really excellent product. I would get rid of all of my other lights if I didn't have 135mm spacing on my fatbike.  
  
**Omega 2000 sewing machine. **This isn't really a bicycling specific product, but learning how to sew has created endless possibilities for gear creation and manipulation. From small things like adding a light clip to a poorly designed seatbag to larger things like making down pogies out of a thrift store down jacket, sewing has changed the way that I think about cycling gear.  
  
**Rohloff. **Not really much to say about this. *Of course you love your Rohloff*. It is functional, beautiful, durable, and consistent. On a snowbike it is particularly noticeable. I do not have to think about diminishing drivetrain performance as I watch the snow and ice accumulate on my parts. In the spring I'll wipe off the salt, change the oil and be ready to roll for another 3000 miles.  
  
**Schwalbe marathon winter tires. **I've wanted this tire for years. I've always looked at my nokians and thought, *more studs and not as much "tread", please*. They are true to width, roll very well, have a reflective sidewall, and stick to ice like velcro. A pair of these on one bike and a pair of Larrys on another make the perfect winter duo. Oh, and I met Michelle because of these, so they're probably the best product of the year.  
  
**White Industries drivetrain. **After a meandering journey that included breaking a Dura Ace crank my A-frame is finally back to the configuration that I love most: White Industries crank and freewheel.  
  
**Ortlieb sport packers. **For a long time I tried to get by using knock-off panniers. They would inevitably break or become increasingly prone to surprise ejection. A year and a half of daily use and these are still functioning just as they were on the first day.  
  
**Specialized Tricross.** I bought this bike early in the year to act as my camping and gravel grinding bike. Almost 5000 miles later I can say that it's proved useful at just about every type of riding. Just today I rode it to work with studded tires, lights and panniers. At the end of the summer I took it on road rides averaging over 20mph. Early in the year I rode it in the Almanzo and the Westside Dirty Benjamin. In between it was used for camping, trips to the grocery store, epic one day rides to Duluth, and a bunch of other stuff. It's not exceptional at anything, but its versatility and willingness to be what I want more than makes up for any shortcomings.  
  
**Light and Motion vis180. **35 lumens. Yeah. I've wanted a light like this for a long time. It has a high quality rechargeable battery, isn't moody like the superflash, and puts out ten times the light of my next favorite taillight. The mount is a bit underwhelming, but the added feeling of security (especially in the winter) makes this one of the more exciting products that I've used. In addition to its sheer lumen-power, it also disperses the light well enough to give 180 degrees of visibility.  
  
**A-train cycles. **This was a big year for A-train as a framebuilder. He started having regular customers both in his rack and frame dealings. He also had the skill, imagination and customer participation to push the limits of his creative passion/prowess. It was exciting both as an observer and a recipient of another fine A-train cycles cycle. I enjoy both of my bikes immensely and look forward to the great things that will come out of the next twelve months.  
  
**Lazer helmets**. I bought one of these about midyear to replace my Bell Sweep. I didn't spend as much money and got a helmet that was superior in every way. I have trouble understanding why other companies are still making helmets. These fit better, look better, and are probably safer as the retention system encircles the head rather than smashing forehead and helmet together.
