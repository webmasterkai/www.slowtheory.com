It's black magic. I finally got my paperwork from Hamline today. It was starting to look like a coma. Wordless whispers on my sobered brow. Oh, I forgot to mention: a new me that touches without feeling, a new me that knows nothing of light and texture, and a new me that twists until he's dizzy. Oh yeah, a new me wound in the walls and on the ceiling--a modern deviation.
