My toilet is broken. I am almost in disbelief. Only one more month at this residence and something breaks. It seems impossible. Except for the night that I moved in, I have thus far avoiding contact with my caretaker. When my refrigerator broke I fixed it. Not in your usual way, of courseÂ­--I don't have that kind of resourcefulness. But I made it work. Machines aren't that different from people. 

Something has been happening lately: I have been waking up within fifteen minutes on either side of seven o'clock in the morning. I cannot explain it, as the time that I go to sleep at night varies by a much greater margin. 

I don't think my computer is up to the task of running itunes 7. I had neglected to upgrade since everything worked and I'm lazy, but apparently the shuffle is not compatible with itunes 6. It takes about 3-4 minutes to switch screens with itunes 7. Stupid technology. I should known better. It's never as simple as buying one new thing. Arbitrary goals for today: find different software that interfaces with the ipod shuffle and further investigate toilet malfunction.
