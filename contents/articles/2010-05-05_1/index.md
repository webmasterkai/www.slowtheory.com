first: yesterday I mounted the tires that I'll be riding for almanzo. it was a bit of a chore to get the requisite pressure to get them to snap into place tubeless, but well worth it. at 40psi they were sluggish on the pavement but once I hit the dirt road (which happens to be in rather poor condition) they really shined, smoothing and gripping the impossibly rough surface. I wish I hadn't mounted them so far in advance, but I was nervous about being able to get them mounted tubeless and wanted to get some miles to make sure everything was going to work properly. the original roval wheels on the bike will need to be sent back for service as they're making an awful noise, so it'll be my only option until mid may. hopefully I don't destroy the tread in that amount of time.

second: optimus prime, my future new fatbike being constructed by the a-train, is now one triangle, some doodads, filing, painting...and well, a lot of stuff away from completion. nonetheless, it is looking great and I'm getting very excited.
