to my self--

today has already started its gradual descent. i have already shown myself as a contemptuous and ill tempered ancient relic of the wit revolution of a few years back. things have changed around campus. a man with a mohawk holding two signs asked me if i could hold that so i took one of the signs from him. he meant the door behind me, but how was i to know? in my first class i bashed on name tags. my professor didn't seem to understand what i was saying and the other students could easily tell that i wasn't like them--older, more intrepid, callous, and belligerent; but entirely stupid and ill tempered.

the morning started with rain. the ride to school was wet and pasty. i didn't want to wear a thermal shirt or a short sleeve shirt and i have nothing in between that suits my hideon. so i wore a thermal. the sun was shining after i got out of my first class and it's turned into quite a lovely day. i spent too much money on a glass of coffee because i was too sleepy this morning to wake up on time. this doesn't bode well for the rest of the semester--waking up late and pedaling furiously to get to class on time; unprepared and writing with a

new pen on my name tag because i forgot to go notebook shopping before class started (i mean, intended to, but by sheer apathy neglected to).

i'm skulking about the computer lab where only the people who are hideons go. the girl in front of me is looking up things on qwestdex--addresses, phone numbers, and names. the three people to my left are from an mtv show. there are probably cameras all around the room documenting their journey to a small university in central minnesota.

she just looked at me because i'm typing furiously. i am a fast typist. it's all that i have going for me in this world of marketable skills.

i should go now; i'm getting uncomfortable.
