When I read, I move my lips with the words. My wife used to point this out to me. I didn't read for pleasure when we were married. I spent most of my time washing the dishes, changing my pants, uprooting weeds, or taking frequent naps. After everyone else went to sleep I would sit at my computer writing. It was all crap, but it felt liberating to take from that part of the night and early morning that no one else wanted and to make it mine. Sometimes she would wake up and come looking for me, but this became infrequent as the regularity of my sleeplessness increased. We just knew. 

One time we were driving to Minneapolis when she turned unexpectedly and said, "We're sitting on the other side of an apocalypse." I wasn't quite sure what she meant at the time, but I recognized a strange mix of certainty and distance that made the statement bigger and more impressive than any of the simple things that were bouncing around our conversation. I sighed and and tried to offer body language that said, "I take you seriously." Sometimes when we said things too seriously the other wouldn't be receptive to it. It was probably the reason that our marriage ended so poorly: we didn't take each other seriously. 

So I started reading a lot of books. I haven't been doing that lately either. It's the first time I've stopped being an avid reader since our divorce. The first couple months I spent reading Kirkegaard, desperately trying to take on a new personality . I liked the idea of becoming pious. I really took it seriously. I embellished my suffering and surrendered completely to what I perceived as divinity, or at least the direction thereof. 

Then I stopped thinking about good and evil so much. I didn't want to become one of those crazy people who stood on the street and yelled about the devil. I felt like I was too smart for that bullshit.
