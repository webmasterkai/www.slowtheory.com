With plans almost settled for my week off I decided that it was a good day to get in some riding practice. The morning was dreary, with the sun shrouded by dense vapor that oozed from the ground and filled the air. It took some effort to convinced myself to get out and ride, but the thought of "alternatively..." was more motivating than any explicit and direct consideration of the matter. I decided to ride the steamroller. I finally have the bike setup such that it's something that I consider riding from time to time. It's mostly a fun single speed road machine with mediocre dirt abilities. I didn't stray much into the dirt today as there was heavy rainfall yesterday evening. The ride was very casual. My gearing allows me to spin up to a comfortable speed, but no higher. I rode along the Minneapolis side of the river and then down Minnehaha. I was surprised at how few people were around the lakes. The mist burned off and the sky turned a beautiful shade of blue. I hopped on the greenway and headed home. 

Monday Ryan and I are leaving for a Big Dummy camping trip. Day one we will ride up to the Chengwatana state forest near the snake river. Tuesday we'll ride as much of the boundary segment of the willard munger as possible, and then return to camp again in the state forest. Wednesday we'll ride home. I have no idea what kind of condition the trail will be in. From everything that I've read it seems to be a little used trail during the summer and may be completely overgrown. The promise of beautiful state park and state forest scenery is too much to resist though. I have to go check it out. This will leave a few days at the end of the week to relax and recover from a difficult summer.
