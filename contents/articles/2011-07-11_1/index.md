It's been quite a while since I wrote about day two of our trip. The past few weeks have been hectic with my move from uptown to longfellow. If day three hadn't been the most awesome day of our trip I would probably just fail to complete *the series*. Since it was, here it is:  
  
We got a *sort of* early start departing from Banning. It was still late morning when we left, but relative to our other departure times it was impressively early. It is not that we are not morning people, but rather that the rainy, gloomy mornings were uninspiring. Leaving Banning it was no different. It was not exactly raining, but everything was soaked. The saturated ground could hold no more water and pooled in a muddy stew at our feet. Our gear was covered in a fine grit and mosquitoes hovered lazily around my eyeballs. I was not particularly enthusiastic that morning.  
  
We packed up our gear and began the climb out of the camping area. It was a quiet morning. We were now thoroughly removed from the city. This was *northern Minnesota*. The rolling hills brought us to an unpopulated part of the world where five acres of land could be had for $14,900. I considered it carefully and almost regretted not making a note of the phone number.  
  
The anxiety of the morning slowly washed away and I became mildly entranced with the serenity of my environment. The clouds thinned, and although there was no sign of the sun I could tell it was like the thinning of pancake batter. Soon. Very soon. Just add water.

We reached a road where we were supposed to turn only to find a DEAD END sign. Hmm. I pondered. I looked at the map. *No, this is certainly not a dead end.* The plan was to travel for a significant distance on it, so we had a decision to make.

We ate kale chips and pondered. My conclusion was this: the road appeared to cross a small river or stream. Since it was a meandering gravel road in *northern Minnesota *it probably didn't have a bridge. We decided to reroute. The change would add a mile or two, but would take us to a different gravel road that had no such ominous declaration of its possible dramatic and detrimental termination. The previous day's navigational miscalculations made me hesitant to try anything too adventurous. The other road proved itself to be quite interesting.  
  
Michelle was flying.

We stopped briefly after the gravel stretch to make *fathersdayphonecalls*. The final push into Wisconsin was via the highway. The Minnesota side was quite nice with an enormous shoulder, little traffic and nice scenery. The terrain was rolling and we had some exciting climbs and descents.

In Danbury we ran into a crazy woman that told Michelle to beware of anything. It seemed like a cheesy horror movie where a woman in a small town sweeping the steps of her shop tries to warn the naive-over-enthusiastic kids about the weirdos that will inevitably kill/scare/maim them. We went to the grocery store for lunch.  
  
After lunch we hopped on the Gandy Dancer. This would take us to Interstate. Navigation done. Kind of. The trail was incredibly soft and I felt like I was laboring much too much to only be traveling at 12-13mph. Up until the Gandy Dancer we were doing well with our pace, moving fast enough to make it to the park at a reasonable hour but not so fast that we were putting ourselves in jeopardy of getting too tired. Once we were on the trail I didn't feel as confident. The same effort was yielding a much lower speed because of the softness of the trail, but moving slower would put us at the park after dark.  
  
The miles ticked off. The sun finally emerged. It was kind of amazing at that moment.

As we approached Frederic Michelle began to get tired. I suspected that she hadn't taken in enough calories at Danbury, or generally for the day. I suggested junk food and attempted to explain the virtues of massive calories while touring. She is normally the healthiest person I've ever known, eating responsible, nutritious and judicious meals and staying away from the calorically dense foods that comprise a staggering portion of my typical ride-food intake. Eating healthfully makes it very difficult to combat the energy expenditure of riding a fifty pounds touring bike for ten hours. She was convinced. We stopped at a gas station. By the time I made it inside the store she had already consumed half a slurp-eee and was armed with a package of swiss cake rolls. *Fuck yeah*.  
  
We stayed a bit too long at the gas station. It was about twenty miles to Interstate. I pushed hard. We were moving fast. Powered by gas station cuisine, Michelle was *back*. We were flying again, holding between 16-19mph...which on gravel, riding touring bikes is an obscenely high pace. Shortly after passing an older couple I felt my front wheel begin to skid. I knew immediately what was happening: one of the numerous sticks that littered the trail had been sucked into my fender. I was about to crash. I attempted to use this knowledge to my advantage, somersaulting off of the trail to the right and nosediving my bike anticlimactically at the side of the trail. It was a lovely fall. I rolled into it with much aplomb, not jamming wrists or landing on the bony parts of my body. *Fleshy parts first, then roll. Get the bike where Michelle won't hit it.* I returned to my feet quickly, laughing and inspecting my fender. It had folded into three sections and was lodged under my fork crown. I unfolded it just as the older couple caught up to us. "We thought you hit a deer with the speed you were going."  
  
We remounted and continued our *sizzling* ride to Interstate. We reached Saint Croix Falls, but I realized I didn't know how to get to the entrance. I thought it was by the river. Shit. We had ridden down the big hill only to realize that we had to ride back up the big hill. Michelle was a trooper and didn't even glare at me too contemptuously when I admitted my mistake (or later when we realized the bottom of the hill was actually 200 feet from our campsite, which was concealed behind some trees).  
  
We reached the campsite where Maria was relaxing in what was one of the most exquisite and beautiful spots I've been camping. It was a "walk in" site that involved little walking, but was completely isolated from other campers and overlooked the Saint Croix. The sun was just setting. It was a glorious. Maria brought beer and burritos. We found ample wood for a fire and spent the evening thoroughly enjoying the rewards of three days of adventure.
