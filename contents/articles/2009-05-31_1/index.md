Everything that could go wrong went wrong. Wait. Start over. Not a lot of sleep and a small breakfast. I didn't have a lot of energy. I met Jeff around Gervais. It was supposed to be an easy day up to Lino Lakes for bikerafting. Things started well. Tailwind. Sunshine. Nice. Then we got lost trying to take a nerdcut. Added about twelve additional miles. Okay. Tired. Hungry. I was smart enough to insist that we get something to eat before getting in the water. Dairy Queen. Fuck yeah. I ate a lot of food that I wouldn't normally eat. Ice cream. We ate outside. It was impossible to deny: the wind was picking up. I could barely keep my food on the table.

We rode towards the mass of lakes without any real plan, found the first beach access point and started unpacking our things. Lack of forethought had us pushing off into the wind. Whatever. I wasn't ten feet from shore and the waves were terrifying. I felt like I was in the ocean. Jeff and I looked at each other. "Should we keep going? Is it dangerous?" We kept going. As the waves hit us from the side I felt my boat drop what seemed like several feet at a time. (I didn't get any pictures from this lake because I was terrified)

We quickly discovered our first big on-the-water mistake of the day (besides getting in the boats at all): Centerville lake doesn't connect to any other lake. We paddled towards Peltier, planning to portage across main street Centerville. We beached amidst a slew of dead fish and garbage. Nice.

After this Jeff stepped on some thorny shit with bare feet and spent a few minutes picking thorns out of his feet. Mistake #(x). We carried our loaded rafts across the street. I cannot imagine what anyone observing thought of the situation.

We crossed Peltier without incident and dropped in on the other side of the dam. The channel leading to the next lake was shallow and dirty. As we continued I noticed that it was becoming increasingly difficult to paddle. I looked over at Jeff and he seemed to be entirely stationary. We fought like this for what seemed like eternity, only to find ourselves ejected into a "lake" that was no more than three feet deep at any point and riddled with thick mud and weeds. Paddling was almost impossible. The wind and the weeds could be overcome individually, but gradually we were forced to the wrong end of the lake as attempting to tackle both resulted in moving backwards. At least a dozen times we just looked at each other and broke out laughing. What the fuck else could we do? There were times we weren't even moving, just fighting not to lose the position that we had gained. In total I think we spent 3-4 hours on lakes and traveled no more than two miles. It was ridiculous. We desperately looked for a place to get out of the water. The "lake" was surrounded by thick weeds and bordered very few roads, one of which was an interstate. After weighing our options we decided to try to exit at a nature center that we had passed just a few minutes earlier. A swift current and strong wind made it impossible to even hold our ground. I jumped out of my boat and started walking. My feet sunk deep into the mud.

We finally got out of the water and found our way back to Centerville, stopping at the first accessible gas station. Neither of us had had water in hours, expecting that the journey would take perhaps 1/10th the time that it had. I suckled my gatorade. We laughed. Epic fail. Everything lately has ended in an epic fail, but very few things more than this. We still had a long ride back to civilization, and directly into a twenty-five mph wind.

I drafted Jeff most of the way home. The day's totals: over nine hours, sixty-five miles on the bike, a few fruitless hours in the boat, and a serious of failures hilarious enough to make the day more memorable for its laughter than its pain.
