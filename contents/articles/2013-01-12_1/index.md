The picture below is posted on the [Wilder Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Wilder-Foot-Races/267158519985689?fref=ts). I might be the second person from the left. Or not. Either way, it looked like this:

Today was the first annual Winter Wilder "30k" free gravel road foot race. The race series was born from Spring Valley's love of things free and gravel. The more serious races are conducted on the same weekend as Almanzo in May. 

Initially I was surprised to find around thirty people at the starting line. For the first year of an event with a minimal budget, zero financial incentive to the organizer, and the challenge of being on the race calendar in January, it seemed like a remarkable turnout. However, further context and consideration reveals sense in it: there are very few challenging, winter running events that are accessible to an intrigued, but inexperienced runner. There is a sharp division between expensive, short-lived, *tame*, 10km events with ample support, and outrageous, ultra-distance, multi-day events that require credentials and a menagerie of expensive gear. How does a person go from one event to the other? The Winter Wilder seems to be filling that gap nicely. I expect that it will grow substantially over the coming years.

The event itself can be summarized by saying:

I ran primarily alone. The race split early and orderly into small groups. While the gravel roads around Spring Valley certainly provide peace and serenity while riding a bicycle, running brought a new life to them. At the Almanzo, there are a lot of people, speeds vary, surges happen, and breaks are taken. You might spend ten or fifteen minutes alone, but rarely more than that. The starkness of being entirely alone for most of the event, with limited mobility, in *harsh* winter conditions was profound. This was amplified by the opportunity to better connect with my environment. When I was down in the valley, shielded from the 25-30mph winds, the flakes floated down as if dropped intentionally from the sky only for my enjoyment. 

I performed well for the first twelve or thirteen miles. I hadn't taken in enough calories, but since we were now facing the wind, I didn't want to stop for any length of time. I was running a deficit and would continue to do so until the finish. I slowed down, but I nonetheless continued making reasonably good progress. Keep warm. Drink. Eat when possible. Keep moving.

I finished in 3h12m.

####The gear

It was a unique race for me. I had never done a race of that length that was enitrely self-supported, in the winter, or on exactly type of terrain. My challenge was to both pare doewn my essential gear, and figure out a way to comfortably carry all of it. 

So, the list of gear:

- **Feet**: Trusty Altra Instincts with Smartwool toe socks.
- **Lower**: Icebreaker 200gram tight, Pearl Amfib tights, and Icebreaker 260gram Tracer pants. 
- **Top**: Icebreaker 200gram baselayer, Patagonia Piton hybrid jacket 
- **Accessories**: Windproof balaclava, Nathan Endurance race vest, Camelbak 2L hydration bladder, Yaktrax Pro (didn't use these), extra mid-weight Smartwool baselayer, Smartwool headband, and RBH Designs Vapor mitts

Everything worked pretty well. I have been impressed by how comfortable the Nathan pack is for running, while still offering just enough space to do most things.

####Nutrition

This didn't work out as well. I brought:

- **Dates**: buried in my pack as emergency food…didn't use as I would have gotten too cold extracting them
- **Agave in a gel dispenser**: froze
- **Chocolate bar**: froze…possible to eat, but difficult
- **Banana, Chia, Flax bread things made by Michelle**: worked wonderfully, but I didn't have very many of them
- **Water**: managed to keep it from freezing. Had plenty, but didn't drink enough and finished with 30 ounces left
