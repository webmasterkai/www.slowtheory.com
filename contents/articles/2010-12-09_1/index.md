sometimes there are words in my mind when I walk places alone. today I remembered them.  
  
making love to my past poetic self this rhapsodic self indulgent manifesto now subsisting on rice beans coffee skin-to-skin contact and words curious imperative pressing words selecting from my armory of toys emblazoned battle tested machinations of underwhelming previous joys to be this *me *to seem enlightened pliable imaginations as I look into my refrigerator and discover that my Bella mushrooms are seeping their own blood and that it pools deliberately and is no less part of *it* than I am part of *we.*
