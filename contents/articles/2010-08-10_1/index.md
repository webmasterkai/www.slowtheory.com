I woke up to the disorienting darkness of a storm gathering. it felt early. it wasn't. instead it was just quiet and dark, the air filled with the rich bounty of what seems like endless days spent sweating and breathing in labored heaves. I absorbed the silence and watched *it *move closer until the first droplets of rain and the rustling of the trees.  
  
ahhhh...the architecture of my mind sipslamming morning coffee and psychotically wishing for baguette while splintering into infinitely divided self-reflectiveness.  
  
we met at the bedlam theatre. I moved around, unaware of the limits of *memory-making* in this/that place. soon it will be gone and my imagination tells me that we will not be. we will be left to observe a new thing and conjure from the recesses when this thing was different. intimacy formed in the transformation of history and delineation between having seen and ready conceptualization. *ha ha ha*. but I'm just a man, so you know...whatever...we traded shoes and moved on.  
  
the play down the street: *bite me twilight*. having successfully avoided both the books and the movies this was my first telling, and in that way it was delightful. it shared in the oral tradition of a story slightly mutating in its retelling, but retaining enough of its original (con|in)tent to attest to the same *truth*. the truth, in this case, was reflexive and indecipherable (in that it was purely reflexive and could only be identified in an impossible realm of objectivity). my button matched my shirt and I laughed honestly no fewer than five times, participating in the demonic room filling group noisemaking at least another ten or fifteen times. it was fun.  
  
to end the evening we succeeded at finding a geocache location and adding our names to the *list.* it was somewhat anticlimactic, but inescapable. *we found. *sometimes it is subtle. beautiful. natural. the compulsion of the human soul to *find.*  
  
then peaceful dreaming and the gathering of/in the sky.
