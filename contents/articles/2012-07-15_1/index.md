For the next month and a half I will be living with Michelle. I put in my notice before we'd decided on a house, so it'll be a less than ideal situation that involves two consecutive moves and a month of living without really have a place to call my own. Michelle and her roommates are wonderful, accommodating people, but we'll be stressing the space limitations of the duplex where we will all be living. Oh well. It'll be quick and adventurous.  
  
Yesterday Kai helped me move some of my things.

A bit more moving today, posting some things on craigslist, cleaning, and then I will be able to leave this crappy place in the past.
