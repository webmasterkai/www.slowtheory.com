I have not been sleeping well. hence, 1:11am and I am awake with the lights off. everything looks normal from the street. *he is sleeping*. inside I am piecing together fragments. words. ideas. pictures. memories. to me, the relevance will not wane. I do not immediately subscribe to chronology, that *this *occurred before *that*. always "being". same eyes. same expression. same sympathetic, compassionate coordination of my face with *now-strangers*. at times furious, then taking the edge off with a beer and a book. focusing on things that are familiar, things that release endorphins, things that intoxicate the soul with their complexity and newness. wrongheaded in the expectation that anyone else should behave better than I should. word count: 111. that is the first that I noticed it. are my eyes simply drawn to repeated instances of the number *1*, or is something else happening? subterranean undercurrents. I attempt to describe without making eye contact exactly what it is that I want: to be specific. I have had a history of existing as an arbitrary thing, a placeholder for something else whose arbitrariness I cannot confirm or deny. easily replaced. I do not want to accept my smallness and interchangeability. I do not want to feel with such intensity when I am of so little consequence.  
  
but what? accept it. revel in it. practice. incremental progress made through repetition. I can feel it boiling up inside of me: ability. or rather, *pli*ability. *malle*ability. I'm not sure. but I will go to bed and dream of nothing.
