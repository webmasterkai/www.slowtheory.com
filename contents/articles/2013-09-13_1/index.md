I've spent a lot of time in the past week thinking about the things that went right and wrong at Superior. As the photo above shows, despite most things falling into former classification, there were a few things that didn't go quite perfectly. I didn't get any blisters and my feet felt great, but I did make the rookie ultra mistake of not trimming my toenails before the race. The nails on my left foot came out a bit gnarly, with one completely detached and free floating. While it was clearly dead, it was also still held in place by enough skin to make it a gruesome act to remove it. Fortunately, Michelle and I had a planned mole removal session with skilled members of her family, so I went for the combo package of mole and nail removal. I ran five miles on the repaired foot this morning at a medium-fast 7:52 pace, and didn't experience any discomfort. The weirdness of the fleshy nub will certainly linger, but I don't think it will be too long before it's just my toe again, weird or not.

As I mentioned, it was my fault, and I walked away completely sold on Hoka for ultras, especially in my unique circumstance of running with a fractured sesamoid. I may dabble with other Hoka models, like the Rapa Nui, but I don't see myself returning to the lower profile shoes that I was using in the spring. The plantar fasciitis that plagued me from January to June is entirely gone. I was able to do large volume, occasional speedwork, and a grip of pavement running without feeling any negative effects on my body. While I'm not convinced that everyone should train or race in Hokas, they seem to be a really good answer for me. This morning at the Mill City Running Friday flapjack run, a rep from Hoka was there offering participants the chance to test-drive a pair. The hesitancy in the room was apparent. This seems to be centered around an already ridiculous aesthetic that is made worse by an insistence on using only the worst color palettes. Anyway, I can accept the nerdishness if it is accompanied by the ability to run healthy and fast. Plus, Karl Meltzer does it.

Shoes worked, and so did food. Clif Shot Blocks were tolerable for the entire day, and when supplemented with Michelle's creations, I had a bulletproof fueling strategy for the fifty. As I begin to think about next year's attempt at the 100...*oh yeah, didn't I mention*? It was my plan after the Moose Mountain Marathon last year that I would someday be one of those fools toeing the line on Friday morning. I was very dogged in my pursuit of the 50, and promised that I wouldn't consider, mention, or commit to the 100 until I'd completed the 50 in a way that made me believe 100 is possible. I've done that now, so I can start thinking about it in vague terms. Anyway, as I begin thinking about the 100, I'll have to start identifying *real food* that works well for me even when I'm not feeling so great. As I learned during an [ill fated training run](http://www.slowtheory.com/2013/08/24/last-long-run-before-superior/), sometimes I do it wrong. I'm kicking around the idea of becoming a *strict* vegan, rather than simply biased towards plants. When I commit to good, healthy food it treats me well. In the throes of hunger, I am often drawn to shit that does positive for me. Finally, I did a great job with electrolyte replacement. I had the right amount, taken *before* proactively rather than reactively, and I kept on top of hydration without gorging on anything and feeling sick or sloshy. 

The taper...oh, the blessed taper. I sort of tapered for other events during the year, but not as much or as seriously as might have been necessary. I reasoned, *Well, that's a B-race*. It was true, in a sense, that most of the other "races" I did this year were simply attempts to facilitate a good environment for longer training runs. I did two runs that were longer than a marathon that weren't races. Each was made much more challenging by the difficult and infrequent access to food and water. Anyway, I had a great taper. Two weeks out, I did my last long run. A week out, I did a medium run on appropriate terrain. The week of the race, I primarily rested. When race day rolled around, I felt fresher than I have all year. I think it's important to recognize this for next year. For the 100, I'm going to need to taper harder than I've ever tapered.

It felt important to jot down a few of these things so that I don't forget them. I tend to make the same mistakes repeatedly. It feels so good **not** to make those mistakes, that I think I want to try that approach in the future.
