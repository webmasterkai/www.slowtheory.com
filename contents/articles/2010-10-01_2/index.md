I decided to learn how to sew. I bought a decent, refurbished sewing machine with a lot of charm and beauty. I've learned how to thread a bobbin, thread the machine, tension it, and produce something not quite beautiful, but most likely functional. I bought a book on sewing and a rotary cutter. It's been really fun so far. I'm excited to have a new creative outlet that will also yield practical things. For instance, I turned a couple pairs of cut off dickies into proper knickers. No more fraying bottoms. Very simple and laughably easy for most, but an exciting skill to have. The most relevant thing that I plan to do is create frame bags for my bicycles, but I think this hobby might extend a bit farther than I'd originally intended. I'm little-kid-giddy about it at the moment.
