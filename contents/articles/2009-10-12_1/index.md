I took it easy today. I've been sick for eight days now. Each day I think that it is getting better and then it doesn't. Last night I didn't sleep much. Rather than ride hard or long, I went to watch the men's 1/2 cyclocross race that was happening at Theodore Wirth. I intended to watch some of the earlier races, but the lackadaisical approach that I took to the day resulted in getting there just in time to see the last race. I situated myself at a log barrier that led into a pretty steep climb. Most guys were dismounting and running, but a couple guys successfully opened gaps by jumping it.

After the race I let one of the guys who comes to the shop take the pugsley for a spin. He seemed to enjoy it, but also seemed to be hurting after an hour of playing in the woods.

It was a nice day to just relax.
