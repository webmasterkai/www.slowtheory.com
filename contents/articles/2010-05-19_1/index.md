I have never been quite so excited to move. I am moving to a better place, in a better location, with a better commute and more convenient access to all of the things that matter to me. For the past several weeks I have been floundering, getting into bad habits because the strain of continuing my life in this place has sapped me of my ability to overcome my inclination towards the mundane. I feel the change coming. It is less than two weeks now. However, I want to start thinking specifically about the things that I intend to change in conjunction with my move. The other day at work Dave and I were talking about "quarterly analysis". The idea has lingered in my mind and I will now take the time for my own quarterly analysis (slightly offset by the inconvenient June rebirth), or rather a quarterly projection of things that I intend to change starting June 1st (and will subsequently reassess on September 1st).

- **No more television.** Much of my time over the past year has been wasted watching television. This  bad habit has overwhelmed many of my good habits including reading, thinking, being and engaging.  I do not intend to hook my television up to anything other than a DVD player. In the autumn I might consider an antenna for watching SPORTS, but alas, this is only a quarterly projection.  
- **No more dining out while at work.** I have backed myself into a rather unpleasant financial situation  that's going to require some diligence to rectify. Step one in this process is going to be getting back  into the regular habit of packing my own lunches, something I was quite good at doing prior to living  here. With the grocery store no longer being an epic journey away, I expect that this one will be fairly  easy to fulfill.
- **Purchase nothing from the bike shop.** Another reason for my financial uncomfortableness is that I  work around things that I love. It's a wonderful thing for many reasons, but it has certainly aided in  my financial undoing. So for arbitrary quarter #1 I will purchase nothing. I will stock up on chains,  brake pads and chamois butt'r before the end of the month. Going three months without a single bike shop purchase would be truly epic.

I will continue this list as things occur to me, but I think that's a good start.
