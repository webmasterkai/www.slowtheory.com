A week ago Michelle and I did the New Belgium Urban Assault scavenger hunt/race thing. I was excited. I thought we could do pretty well in the coed division. We had our route planned and executed it well. The only snafu came in the form of some bad luck. The slow people went to our second stop first, meaning that we arrived at roughly the same time as many other people. We waited for fifteen minutes. I knew our chance to win was gone. Nonetheless, the obstacles were fun and it was a beautiful morning to be riding a bike. We finished 7th out of 166 coed teams. I'm not sure that we could have won given a more fortuitous order, but I think we might have placed well enough to win a PRIZE. The winning couple said that they did not encounter any lines. Even though the after party was at 10:30am, we enjoyed abundant, free-flowing beer and bike games with Team Chips and Guac (Ryan and Joey). It was F-U-N.  
  
This Saturday we attended the Autumn Brew Fest. Our entry was paid in the form of a 2.5 hour volunteer shift. I wasn't particularly excited about volunteering, but it ended up being a lot of fun. I walked around collecting compost, recycling and trash and was rewarded with two hours of drinking delicious beers (except that smoked Hefeweizen...wtf guys?!). Afterwards we went to a chili dump before returning home for an early bedtime. Funfunfun.
