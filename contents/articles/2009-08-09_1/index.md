Yesterday I helped the a-train move to his new apartment. To facilitate the process we borrowed an eight foot bikes at work trailer from a customer at the bike shop. I've always lusted after that trailer so it was a fun opportunity to try it. I headed down to bloomington early in the morning to pick up a couch. Visually the couch seemed almost laughably small, but its innards consisted of a heavy framed pullout bed. It was still a bit lighter and less cumbersome than the couch that I moved on a much smaller trailer a few years ago, but it still made me nervous for the first few miles. Traffic was light and we stuck primarily to straight, wide, flat roads. Aside from mashing my way up the hill on pelham the trip was rather uneventful. After working the couch awkwardly up a couple flights of stairs and eating some food, the a-train and I set off to pick up the bed, dresser, chair, and a few other miscellaneous items. It was a fun day of movie stuff.
