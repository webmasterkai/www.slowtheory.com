the north shore ultra was canceled just days before it was to take place. disappointing. after participating in events like the almanzo 100 it was sad to see so little passion go into the formation of an event. very little talk. last minute cancellation. excuses. an offer for a "partial refund" on the registration fee. the entire thing has left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I doubt I'll be participating next year, if in fact the thing exists next year.

next year: 10,000 miles. that's the idea anyway.
