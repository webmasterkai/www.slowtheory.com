It is cold. It is morning. It is cold and I am perpetually afraid that my body is not absorbing nutrients. Daylight. Grogginess. Apple Iphone Alarm Clock Wake Up. Proper noun drawl. Spring presented itself, casual and unafraid. Playful, it has slipped away into hiding. I did not plan it this way, but yesterday was new thing day. I went into the bike shop to finish putting together my new singlespeed. My friend and coworker, the A-train, built me a new frame to replace my tired but beloved Raleigh singlespeed. While I working UPS Rick delivered a mound of boxes. 'What do I care? I'm not for real working.' As I leaned over the mound to retrieve a chain I noticed a box that, while not peculiar, seemed to be begging my attention. Alpacka Raft. Tim L-----. New Raft! New Bike!
