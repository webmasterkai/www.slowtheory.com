September was a rough month for cycling. I was sick for almost two weeks, I spent a few days out of town hiking on the superior hiking trail, and it rained...a lot. All of these things contributed to what has historically been my best cycling month of the year turning into one of my worst. It's not the end of the world though. I'm still on pace for a 10,000 mile year and I have some big tour divide related goals for October. My work schedule really relaxes this time of year and I'll have plenty of time to get in a lot of miles before the winter hits. Truthfully, I'm a bit excited for winter. The prospect of a new fatbike and my improved commute this year have me excited. I'm sure this attitude will change about mid January when I'm *fucking freezing*.  
  
I made a couple of bike moves in September: sold the Big Dummy and finished OPTIMUS PRIME. I hadn't changed anything about my bike collection since acquiring the Tricross in February. I'm a little bit proud of that. Living in Uptown the Big Dummy was much more a pain in the ass than anything. I'm close enough to everything important that I can use just about anything, including my feet, to get what I need.
