Last night I went to target to get dishsoap. Downtown Minneapolis, Saturday night, 8pm. I parked on ninth. There was yelling. I could not immediately understand what was happening. Sometimes when I am out in the world noise becomes amplified to the point that everything sounds like yelling. It was different. "Loving GOD..." and "HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THE DEVIL?" It went on like this. Distinct voices volleying back and forth, one ignorant of the other while the other was simply disinclined. My eyes darted back and forth in a semicircle before I managed to assess the situation as existing outside of my head. There was a man standing on a box at ninth and Nicollet. A man of god spouting rhetoric. Across the street there were a line of bums yelling at him about the devil. A group of glittery girls migrating from one bar to another walked by yelling, "I love god too...excuse me mister, what are you preaching from?" He was unaffected. Nothing could dislodge him from the trance that he was in. His level of disconnection almost made me believe in god right there and then. I walked inside. A man from store security was moving towards the door, talking into his radio. "We've got an actual soapbox situation out here..." I expected him to be gone by the time that I left. I did my shopping. Dishwasher soap, hooks, nails, and emergency coffee. I left. He was still there, still full of passion, still oblivious to his surroundings. I quietly wondered about this man's day prior to standing on this box. What did he do? Did he go to work? The grocery store? Does he have a family? He was a man who had appeared out of nowhere in my life, and even standing inches in front of me remained elusive. Earlier in the day I was at the grocery store. I walked in to an announcement over the intercom system: "Once again, if you are the person who tied your dog to an ashtray in front of the store, he ran away...he is gone." I snickered. I shouldn't have. It was a mean thing to do, but the announcement seemed so unusual. I wondered if he was that man with a lost dog, lulled into religious zeal by a disfigurement of everything that he knew.
