Last night hip alex and dave rode home with me. The plan was to go to my place, pick up my big dummy, and then go to alex's new place in northeast minneapolis to pick up a rug that he was generously giving me. Things were very ordinary until we crossed the sabo bridge on the greenway. *Everyone* started racing us. It wasn't in that secret way that is common in the recreational bicycling world. No, it was aggressive and obvious, but as far as I could tell completely fun spirited. The first of many was an impressive fixed gear rider lugging a massive chain and messenger bag. He was riding neon green flat pedals and was hanging in there at 22mph. It seemed like we were having fun, so I brought the pace up to around 25mph. Just then we passed another group of riders that decided to *have a go*. It was incredibly bizarre. Everyone on the greenway seemed to be ready for an impromptu secret race, whether it meant ditching friends or riding past their exits. *Fucking weird.*  
  
The ride to alex's was fairly uneventful. Once we were there we checked out his new place. It was neat and filled with people who seemed interesting. I loaded the rug on to my big dummy and we rode home where we ate my new favorite concoction: brown rice, red peppers, carrots, mushrooms and stir fry sauce. I'm trying to use three or more ingredients in my meals.  
  
The rug is simply amazing. It's an expensive, high quality thing and I felt somewhat guilty taking it, but I also couldn't resist the offer. It transforms my living space in a way that a photo cannot capture. Oh, and it's nice to touch.
