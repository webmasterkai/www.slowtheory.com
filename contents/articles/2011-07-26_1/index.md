Busy busy busy. So says the Bokononist. Summer has been busy in a much less profound, but no less interconnected way. Michelle's birthday was last week, so we spent a lot of the week and weekend getting completely rad. Lately we've been doing a lot of alleycats and unsanctioned, time-based, bike competitions. We've been slowly improving and are now in the position where we often get to take home some kind of prize! It's exciting, sort of.  
  
On Saturday there was a scavenger hunt loosely associated with the Bicycle Film Festival. The plan was to do the event and then immediately ride to meet a bunch of people at Sunrise for an overnight camping trip. The scavenger hunt was a real *scavenger hunt*. It was comprised of a list of either things of photos that each team sought to acquire. Items were given a value between one and three points based on the difficulty that one might have in procuring the item. Not all items were required. Points would be tallied. The team with the most points would win.  
  
Aside from wasting too much time snapping bridge photos (due to a resounding lack of clarity regarding *bridge photos*), we planned and rode well. The totals were announced. We finished second and took home matching Banjo Brothers messenger bags. *Cool*.  
  
Therealsideburnz unexpectedly appeared late last week from his home in Honolulu. After the scavenger hunt we met up with him and then rode to meet with an additional crew of six for bikecamping. It was a short, but fun ride out to the Lake Zumbra group camp where everyone got totally awesome. Lake beers were had, hippie smores were consumed, shins were bashed, storms were reveled in, and so on.
