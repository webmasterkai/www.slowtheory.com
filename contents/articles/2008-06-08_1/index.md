Reliably, my day off was again cloudy and extremely humid. I woke up in the morning with the vague intention of riding to the west and finally discovering the mythical Luce Line trail. It's been in the back of my mind since the first time that I biked to my parent's house. The trail runs from the western metro to Cosmos, so I would only have to deal with perhaps twenty miles of roads. Of course, given that we needed to return in the same day the plan only involved a limited section of trail. Aside from some mechanical problems the trip to the trail was rather uneventful. We were duped by a map on the Greenway into taking a different route than I had planned, but through a series of lucky and at times improbable decisions we meandered our way to the actual start of the trail. Extremely pleased with ourselves, we stopped to fuel up at Bruegger's in Wayzata. After navigating the deadly suburban streets we returned to the relative peace and serenity of the unpaved trail. I was riding the La Cruz with extremely slow and heavy 32mm tires. I had also recently installed new drop bars, so the combination resulted in a level of discomfort that was disconcerting so early in the ride. Fortunately Ryan was on his fixed gear and Jeff was on his 29er, so I could take solace that my riding partners were possibly even more senselessly equipped. The trail was a nice change of pace. There were very few people and only the occasional car at an intersection. The trees offered a bit of shade, and although the humidity was high, I started to feel much better. After Watertown the trail conditions started to worsen. It was still completely rideable, but the softer surface meant that more effort was going into each pedal stroke. About halfway between Watertown and Winsted we turned around. The ride home was marked by suicidal squirrels and lots of bugs. I thoroughly regretted my decision not to wear glasses as bug shrapnel lodged in my eyes and made it difficult to see. My food ran out quickly and I started to get pretty tired around mile sixty-eight. However, once we returned to pavement about eight or nine miles later I started to feel very energetic. I'm not sure if it was the decreased effort required on the smooth surface or the last bits of food that I had eaten when I started to feel stale and tired, but from that point on the rest of the ride was easy. Three deer jumped across the path in front of me, but I was too slow with my camera to get a picture. Just imagine though, three deer. Yep. As we approached Theodore Wirth it started to rain. It seemed a fitting way to finish such an epic ride. Like Paris-Roubaix, except with squirrels and rollergirls instead of cobbles. In the end we did about fifty miles on gravel and fifty on paved surface. It was a nice mix and one of the more enjoyable centuries that I've done.
