I wanted to make Sunday's ride count since I will miss the next two weeks while I am on vacation in Hawaii. The answer: a second February century. I had such an easy time the last time around that it didn't seem like a particularly ambitious plan. We started as a three person group. It was cold, barely out of the single digits. Certain clothing choices were made nearly impossible, as in the case of my helmet. I opted to wear my snowboarding helmet and goggles. It's a setup that works very well below fifteen degrees and not at all above fifteen degrees. My regular bicycle helmet has the opposite problem: below fifteen degrees and my ears get painfully cold. The choices were to freeze in the morning or sweat in the afternoon. It made the morning tolerable. My legs felt quite good as we spun casually along the same route as last week. The only significant difference in the plan was to take the other LRT trail once we got to Hopkins. The cold was accompanied by glorious sunshine, so I didn't complain too vigorously.

We took an extended stop at the ski/golf shack near Wirth. There weren't any cars in the parking lot. Most weekends the lot is packed, so I can only assume that the ski trails were just as closed as the mountain bike trails, raising the curious question: why was the shack open? In any case, I was happy that they were there, even if only for non-paying bicyclists. Ryan changed out some gear and we were on our way.

The change in the landscape from the previous week was dramatic. Places that were covered in snow were now a mix of exposed grass, dirt and ice. Jeff was smart enough to anticipate the change and switch to studded tires. I was not. This left me as the only person in the group without studs. The path along Brownie lake was an icy mess. I ended up walking most of it. It was nice to get off of the bike. Before long we were at the Depot. I had a brownie, a sandwich, and a cup of coffee. The brownie and sandwich were lackluster. It was a shame that they didn't have any delicious pumpkin bread.

The LRT started off promising with bare limestone, but quickly deteriorated into long sections of glare ice. I moved slowly and talked myself through it--"stay cool." This went on for about five miles before I decided that I'd had enough. It wasn't so much the going forward part that was daunting, but knowing that I'd have to go back over the patches that I'd already crossed. "I'm turning around." To make up the miles we headed down the other, more familiar LRT trail. This one was in much better condition. Along the way we passed a small body of water with an apparent race track on it. Ice race? For sure.

Since I didn't have studs I served merely as photographer. A few people gathered on the edge of the path to watch the race. After a warmup lap the race was on. Jeff had the advantage as 1.) he's superhuman, and 2.) he was rocking 588 studs versus Ryan's 212. His lap finished without incident in under two minutes. As the course was roughly 1/2 mile long it meant that he was averaging over 15mph on a lake. Impressive! Ryan had a couple of crashes, but still finished in under three minutes. It was a nice diversion.

We rode the trail until we got to a point where it would have been foolish for me to continue on regular tires. It was fine, since we'd made up most of the miles. We rode back and stopped at Arby's. Fast food twice in one week. Bizarre. I was hungrier than the previous week, and definitely drinking more due to overheating. It had warmed up considerably in the two hours between the Depot and Arby's.

We rode most of the rest of the Greenway before Jeff and I branched off at Hiawatha. Ryan had had enough of the cold and was going home to enjoy a bath and a book, a fact which he was forthright in announcing, almost to the point of taunting. Oh well, only another three hours of riding. As we were crossing the Ford bridge we saw an idiot walking across the Mississippi. Two of his buddies were on the shore. He raised his arms at them, as if in frustration that they wouldn't follow. He climbed on to a buoy. Continued walking. We stood transfixed on the bridge waiting for disaster. We left before he'd completed his long journey. I fully expected to wake up this morning to a story about a man falling into the river.

Riding along the river road was quite beautiful. The sun was setting and the temperature was comfortable. We raced along trying to make it to the bridge before the sun fully set. It was a fun chase. On the Mendota side of the river things were calm. Traffic was light and the city had a faint afterglow from a day of absorbing sunlight. We stopped for more pictures and shenanigans. It's the fun part about winter riding: the meandering. The casualness. Through downtown to the Vento. My legs started to feel it around this time. A new sensation--tired legs. The trails were surprisingly rideable. Zero crashes. A miracle?

I stopped to have chili and cheesecake with Jeff and Kara. I didn't stay long since all of my clothing was damp from sweat, and the temperature was plummeting. The final fifteen miles weren't very much fun. I tried to get warm. I tried to pedal smoothly. I tried to enjoy the starshine. I somewhat succeeded, but towards the end I just wanted it to be over. Eventually it was.
