I often find it difficult to plan *events*. People are compelled to be perpetually in a position affording impulsiveness. A typical response to proposing a thing sounds like this: "yeah, I'll probably do that (I have no conflicting plans and it appeals to me at this moment), but let me wait until 30 minutes before the thing happens to tell you." Very few people consider a thing, decide it is a good idea/tolerably well-timed, and say, "very good...very good, indeed!" Bike shop people are no different, so when, weeks ago, I proposed a Sunday afternoon BBQ for a yet-to-be-determined-date-and-time, the response was a mixture of silence and indifference. It was not until Sunday afternoon at 4pm that I found out that everyone was super-duper thrilled to have a shop BBQ.  
  
Kai took the Ogre w/Surly Bill trailer to the local hardware store where he purchased a display model grill. The dumbfounded staff stood, mouths agape, completely helpless to fulfill their offer to help load it into his vehicle. Meanwhile, after a spirited commute, Bryce and I produced three beers and a salad. The weather canceled its near certain thunder-tornado. Ugur and Margot provided lamb, a drill, and a voltage converter. It was almost surreal. A perfect afternoon BBQ manifested out of only the vaguest notion of one. Perhaps I need to simply embrace last minute planning.  

I've been finding my groove sewing. This is a frame bag that I made for Michelle last week. The frame is a rather large touring bike, so there was plenty of room to make a bag that could easily fit a 100oz. hydration pack, with room left for snacks, tool, and more. After ignoring my sewing machine for several months, it took failing miserably at the first couple bags to reclaim enough skill and technique to produce something less than shameful. I'm happy with this one.
