I see other people now. people on bicycles. riding to work. doing other things. the city is lively in the morning when I go to work. I have started seeing people I know. friendly waves. occasionally stopping to talk. it seems like things should feel less the same, but they do not. I am still quiet. I still love watching the sun set. the picture above was taken on my way home from work one day. it was two blocks of sheer beauty before the moonscrapers blocked it from my view. maddening beauty. I see things. the trickiest part of my new commute is that third now exits only on to the freeway due to the stadium construction. here to there is easy enough, but unidirectional roads make there to here much more difficult. I have finally found a reasonable route that takes me past the sculpture gardens. it is a nice end to my day. allergies are bad. the sun is hot. life is difficult. the uncertainty of the future of the world is daunting. but sometimes things are beautiful, and that is reason enough to wake up the next day. even though the sunset lasted for me for only two blocks, I will never forget it.
