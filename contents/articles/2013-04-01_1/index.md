####One and two.

Two weeks ago I began working at Cycles for Change in Saint Paul. On the same day, we started our weeklong house and dog sitting duties at Dan and Kari's. The transition was odd and alarming to my habit-centric mind. I was living in a new house, with new responsibilities, new sleep patterns, in a different bed, with different smells, and thinking about different things. It was difficult. I reminded myself that it's good for the soul to find new things and to face new challenges. We've been very much living like old people, trying to settle into sustainable rhythms that undulate in a way that preserves and accumulates. It's been stressful and has invoked a perpetual irritability that I am just beginning to shed. I have started to think about *right now* and I already feels years younger.

####Three.

I've been sick. Two or three weeks ago I first slumped into illness for a day or two. Time passed. I felt satisfactory, but not great. Then I got sick again in a less ambiguous way.

####Four.

While I was sick, I did very little running, so over the weekend I tried to condense a week's running into two days. Saturday I went out for a 23 mile Greenway/Cedar Lake loop. Sunday I added another 9.2 via a meandering exploration of Northeast Minnneapolis. "Mid-City Industrial - Category 15: Northeast's newest neighborhood, Mid-City Industrial is comprised of businesses of all sizes." I looked it up to see if it's actually considered *Northeast*. I've been drawn to running through industrial areas recently. The ease, solitude, and presence of machinery inspires me. This weekend it's back to the woods, however, for my second race of the year. It's short enough that I could probably push hard and be "competitive", but I plan to use it primarily to get ready for the 50km race the following weekend.
