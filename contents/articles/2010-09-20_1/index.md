monday morning. woke up early in a generic-brand-nyquil-impersonator-haze. I spent much of yesterday napping. thursday morning I woke up with a slight cold. by yesterday it reached its crescendo. I cannot decide if I was fortunate or unfortunate to perfectly encase my illness in a *vacation*. on one hand, I was hiking up north and had so much to distract my mind from the fact that I was sick. on the other hand, it was the only time this year that I will have more than four days off from work. either way, my symptoms are beginning to dissipate. today I will return to work and normalcy. eventually I will sort through the pictures and stories.  
  
I returned home to my new sewing machine. I bought it rather impulsively with the vague notion that I'd use it to make bicycle bags, but also because I liked to think of it sitting in my living space. it's beautiful.
