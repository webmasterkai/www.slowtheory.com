the third week of january is the coldest, statistically. it is the third week of january.  
  
the weekend was marvelous. saturday night we went to a holiday party. I dressed like an adult--suit, tie, dirty hair, beautiful woman next to me and mukluks. near transcendental. the group consisted of green cleaning women and their bearded men. it is difficult in such a group to feel anything more than generic, so I clung to my glass of wine, trying to limit my outpouring to witticism and coyly placed anecdote. we both participated in the white elephant game, receiving (in my estimation) the two finest gifts up for grabs. this included a dish towel with a creepy, embroidered thing and a naked woman back roller. both have been subsequently utilized and found delightful. I am now pro-thing.  
  
sunday. we woke up late. 10am. I was thrilled to have slept so long and awoke to nothing more than the disinclination to sleep any longer. I minimally aided michelle in preparing a fantastic breakfast. in the afternoon we went to fort snelling to cross country ski. the last time that I skied was in middle school. the loop that we intended to do was about three miles. the first attempt did not go particularly well. I was clumsy and michelle's hands were painfully cold. we returned to the visitor center and hung out there for twenty minutes before trying again. this time it was AMAZING. my mind and body both suddenly remembered how to ski and I had no trouble keeping up. michelle switched to more substantial mittens. our problems were solved and we could simply enjoy the lovely late afternoon. I think I might love skiing.  
  
in the evening we went to ecopolitan and had a *fucking amazing *dinner.  
  
finally, we saw *black swan* at the lagoon.  
  
it was an amazing weekend.
