january first. time to start contextualizing, decontextualizing, making a mess, staring upward as if expecting the sun to crash into my face in a blurry mess of shattered star. I run my hand over the surface of my other hand. it does not matter in which direction I perform this action. they are both dry and cracking. the moisture has been sucked out of my body and no amount of anything will change that until spring. the days are once again getting longer, but so slightly, and we are about to enter the january that I have predicted will be the coldest in human history. I am okay with that. whenever there is snow in december there is cold in january. subjectively, this is true. it always has been. yesterday we had a belated celebration of something. I walked away with a stack of things and a pile of cash. this is christmastime, and through non-participation I have become an exploiter. grimly handling my new possessions with nothing to offer in return. I just don't believe... clementine has been nice to me. it matters because I need to know how she feels about me before she learns false presentation. a person cannot be sure of anything about adults. they lie. I know this because I have an inner monologue that tells me. people talk to me and I either hate them or love them, and it rarely matches my indifferent expression. I will approach this year scientifically, conducting experiments and gathering data. when you see me I will almost certainly have a pencil in my hand and be wearing a lab coat.

later I went to a new year's party.

and now it is now.
