I'm back from three days of touring on the Big Dummy. I took very few pictures during this trip, mostly out of laziness, so this post will be tediously boring (edit: I added a bunch of photos that ryan took). Monday morning we started north with a huge tailwind. It was an amazing scenario that's never happened to me before: I benefited from an all day tailwind without the consequence of ever having to ride back into it. Sweet! At Hugo we turned north and continued in that direction for the next thirty-five miles. During this time our speeds ranged from 17-22mph. With the amount of gear that we had, it was pretty exhilarating, and in stark contrast to my previous loaded trips on the Dummy. Once we reached Pine C ity we turned east and headed for the C hengwatana state forest and Snake River campground. 

I wasn't exactly sure where the Munger trail started, but the plan was to continue on it to Saint C roix state park where we would camp for the night. We were at about eighty miles for the day, and presented with the option of either, riding this for another twenty miles:

...or getting a site at the Snake River campground for the night. We opted for the latter. Given the condition of the trail, it would have taken another three hours to get to the state park. Additionally, the Snake River campground was entirely empty. Twenty-six sites, zero people. After selecting from a number of delightful spots we hopped in the Snake River to trade one kind of filth for another. Unfortunately it was no deeper than three feet, so I laid down like in it as if it were a giant bathtub. There was a man fishing just downstream. He must have either been entertained or horrified. The rest of the evening was spent eating and learning the many, seemingly bizarre and arbitrary rules of cribbage. It was incredibly humid and I didn't sleep very well. Even with a new tent instead of my bivy, I felt like I was sleeping in a sauna. 

The morning brought light rain. Breakfast was interrupted and I ate oatmeal inside of my tent. It was at this point that I started to think about finding a spot to camp closer to home. The rain meant that the already difficult Munger trail would be basically unrideable given my bike setup. It would either be a day of hiking and sitting in my tent or a day of riding through intermittent storms. We looked at the map and decided to head east into Wisconsin. We'd turn south at Grantsburg and ride to Interstate Park. This would put us within fifty miles of home rather than eighty. I was not looking forward to another long day along highway 61. The weather got worse. It started to rain lightly and the sky to the west grew increasingly menacing. The wind picked up and I started to worry about the volume and speed of the traffic. I only had a cheap state map, so our selection of roads was limited to those very large ones most likely to be of use to a motorist buying a map at a gas station. It started to seem dangerous so when I saw an abandoned warehouse on the side of the road I suggested that we pull off the road. We went around tugging on doors until we found a small shed that was unlocked. We rolled the bikes inside just as the storm amped up its intensity. 

The rest of the ride was in a slight drizzle and under the ever present threat of another fierce barrage of wind, rain and lightning. It took about one hundred miles of riding, but my legs were finally starting to warm up. We rotated turns at the front and pushed hard towards Saint Croix falls. 

After a frigid descent we reached Interstate Park. We came in from the wrong direction and ended up on a hiking trail that was completely unsuitable for Big Dummy transport. There was an extremely slick set of stairs dropping eighty feet or so, without much of a railing. I decided to amble down it with my bike anyway. It went pretty well, except that when I was scouting sans bike I slipped on the stairs and fell on my ass. This was a nice warning though, as I switched to grippier trail shoes for the rest of the descent. I reached the bottom only to realize that there was another staircase going up the same distance on the other side of the gorge. The highway was only a hundred feet off the trail, so instead of dragging my bike up it I opted to drag it through the forest to the car entrance. It was pointless and anticlimactic, but also really awesome. 

Interstate Park is not very much fun. It's like a giant parking lot for RVs and camper-vans and all sorts of abominations with axles and engines and shit. We got a nice spot on the river, and so long as I didn't look the other direction it was nice. Still, it's not a place I plan to revisit any time soon. I'm also sure that there's a bit more to the park that fatigue prevented me from exploring. The showers were broken, so I didn't even get to indulge in the once aspect of space age camping that most interested me. 

By evening it was nice and cool. I knew that it would be a much better night for sleeping. I woke up at 4 or 5am shivering. My 45 degree bag wasn't quite up to the task. It was funny because the previous night I hadn't even used a sleeping bag. I put on some extra clothing and went back to sleep. I slept until 8am. I made coffee and we tore down camp. It was a beautiful morning and I was excited that our last day of riding would be our best. There was a nasty crosswind for much of the ride, but we covered the remaining miles quickly and reached home just after 2pm. My legs felt better than they had the previous days.
