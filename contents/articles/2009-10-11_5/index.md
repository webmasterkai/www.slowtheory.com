it is later in the day. after months of filling my sundays with activities and obligations I decided to spend today relaxing. here's a list (in no particular order): started moving music from my old computer to my new computer, walked to the park with the ladies, ate a cookie, took an hour long nap, alternated drinking coffee and beer, splashed around in the weird shallow swimming pool at bryn mawr meadows, wrote a blog, wrote another blog, updated my bicycles page, sat on the porch, walked around the block and said hello to a man with a black dog (he grunted), browsed bike pictures on flickr, paid my bills, balanced my checking account, left ebay feedback, realized that I was acting insecure, decided to stop, facebooked, verbthings, talked unintelligently about language, played mariokart, took a shower.

that's it. lazy. really fucking lazy. it was nice. I woke up from my nap about thirty minutes ago. we'll watch a movie and then I will go to bed. I'll drink another beer and possibly eat another cookie. tomorrow I will wake up and patterns will reemerge.
