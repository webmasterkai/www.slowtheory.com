life is somehow blurry--­the edges uncaressed, unmanipulated, formless, shapeless and askew. my eyes dim and recessed, wanting nothing of mornings to which nights are not conclusions. a cultural examination, vivisected at the mutant hands of ex-jaded playthings. ha ha. these breedlings kicking up their heels and showing their woman parts­I want them not. I want them never. (Lies, of course) I like the swagger, the bounce, the re-imagination of pink panther with slicker hair and a turned up collar. out of the noise taking almost nothing, not words or language, but the primitive designations of prey and preything. I watch her movement. I watch her bend and manipulate in the most delicious ways. and this...this savage contact of eyes, this wasted forgetfulness. greetings. in literal heaps, amassing on my floor like tricked out braindeads, begging for the simplest kind of communication. amongst them this stranger whose glance I will not miss. eventually it must fall upon me as it moves like any other undirected glance in the mind of the curious--­around and around and around, studying the subconscious and parsing information into two categories: yes and no. I like to think of what it means to them that this place exists and that irregular people lack the clean lines and simple thought patterns necessary to recognize it. and later I am gone. back at home, having rested and worked and slept for days.
