I'm tired of changing my name when I go places. I'm tired of a being a dark secret. I want to go into a cave and chew on wild strawberries, spit them out in disgust, and shake the hands on a clock. I want time to pass differently. I want the sky to be a different shade of night. I want to enjoy sleep and have nothing else to do. I'm going to bed now. Fuck.
