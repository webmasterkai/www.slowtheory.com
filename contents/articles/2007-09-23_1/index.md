pink automation.  
highly treasured.  
or so it can be--is it?  
words retarding  
one pound of flesh,  
observed beaten whipped pureed  
in a quart size deli container.  
stargazing  
for driftwood.  
ha ha ha  
fuck it (go away).  
uptraded to  
smiles regarding  
an insistence  
of spirit  
chopped-beaten-whipped-pureed.  
or so it seems--  
told with locked eyes  
and clenched bowels.  
haha ha  
the neon glow  
"I call it a Cityscape.  
It's like a Landscape but filled with  
concrete statuettes and billowing  
clouds of smoke."  
--which has since been  
outlawed  
however dependent  
this pink automation  
has become.  
no one cries.  
ha ha ha  
no one cries.  
and the deli-woman  
never gives you exactly  
one pound.  
it's almost meaningless.
