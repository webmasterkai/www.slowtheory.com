I have a fucking headache. I find it disturbing when retribution is exacted under the guise of judgment. Consequently, I didn't sleep well last night. My forehead is burning and it feels a lot fucking warmer in here than the actual temperature would indicate. Maybe a week ago I encountered the yelling man on Dale street again. This time I was moving too quickly and couldn't decipher his words, but I liked the regularity of it.

I restarted my netflix account. I stopped it over a year ago because I disliked watching movies on my small computer screen. Around Christmas I acquired a television that is so well suited to watching movies that I have felt neglectful not using it more. So here we are. I will attempt to be clever and knowledgeable. I have to get ready for work now.
