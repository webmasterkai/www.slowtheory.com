nine hours sleep. repeat. "another day". spring has arrived with new sensations: warmth, stress, fatigue, periodic giddiness. out of control at times, the dreams tighten their hold on me as I begin to go to bed earlier while the sun stays out later. our paths bend to intersect. work is palatable, albeit intrusive. tacking on an hour long commute at the end of a ten and a half hour day becomes exhausting very quickly. I'll adapt. either psychologically in the form of lethargy, or physically in the form of exceptional strength, I'll adapt. this attempt made not from a genuine compulsion to create, but rather as recitation of a curious skill left somewhere on the distant timespace horizon. I think of easy books to read. anything to get my mind working again.

yesterday between work shifts I went packrafting. a woman started asking questions about my vessel. "I don't think you're crazy," she qualified. oh? why would you? the throngs migrated around the edges of the beautiful day, pace by pace succumbing to the well traveled route of redundancy. compulsory. migratory. etc. I repeat.

I hold things together. time passes. I become older. mathematically I can hope that I have a dozen years before I can truly start regretting my lost youth. a dozen years is a long time. right? I think of the last dozen and basically everything that has ever happened to me has occurred during those years. so much. so much to pass over, not through.

I try to make things more efficient. compartmentalize the mundane. grocery shopping should not take up as much time as it does. more time to 1.) create, 2.) engage, 3.) devour, 4.) orchestrate. begin. (the ctrl button on my keyboard is now completely gone. I press my finger to circuitboard and pray.)
