description: Due to the Bondi B2's inclination to self-destruct, I spent four months of the summer running in the Hoka Stinson Evo Tarmac. Here I reflect on their ability to navigate varied terrain, promote good health, and improve performance.

#### Backstory

After spending the first part of the year running in either the Inov-8 Trail Roc 255 or the Altra Instinct, I succumbed to a mild case of plantar fasciitis. After taking three weeks off in June, I returned with heightened awareness of the need to stay healthy while training for an ultra. The Superior 50 mile trail race loomed as my biggest race goal of the season, and with only ten weeks to go, I wanted to ensure that I would remain injury-free. In July, a wild seven day stretch had me completing both the Afton 50k and the Eugene Curnow trail marathon. The pair of Hoka Bondi B2s that I used for both races performed exceptionally well, but suffered from one alarming shortcoming--[they fell apart](http://www.slowtheory.com/2013/07/15/hoka-bondi-b2-review/). Hoka was kind about replacing them, but after three more attempts with the same defective model, I grew weary of breaking in new shoes. I decided to get a pair of Stinson Evo Tarmacs for training and reserve the Bondis for race day.

#### Performance

My first impression of the Stinson Evo Tarmac was that it felt *soft*, even when compared to the Bondi B2. The initially off-putting squish faded after a couple of runs, but noisy footfall persisted. Due to a shattered sesamoid, my stride has a certain asymmetry to it which was accentuated by the higher drop and flatter bottom of the Tarmac. No matter. I could accept that my reasonably quiet footfall became something more of an inconsistent thwacking. I began running exclusively in them and marveled as I found myself comfortably logging big mile weeks and back to back long runs without any hint of my body breaking down. My legs felt fresh and springy, the plantar fasciitis disappeared, and I was running faster than ever before. At Ragnar I found myself cruising at 7:00 min/mile. Doing three such legs in 24 hours would have previously been an invitation for disaster, but now I was feeling good enough to wake up and run the following day.

When September rolled around, I had become so indebted to the Stinson Evo Tarmac that I decided to run the rugged Superior trail race in them. Despite their designation as strictly a road shoe, they performed admirably on the roots and rocks. Admittedly, they were not the quickest on loose downhills, but by mile thirty I was passing and not getting passed. I give a great deal of the credit to the shoes for minimizing the damage incurred during twelve hours on the trail. My feet felt great, I ran a consistent race, and ended up finishing in 12th place. A month after Superior, I ran Twin Cities marathon, taking a staggering 32 minutes from my previous best time and sliding in 3 minutes under the 3:30 goal that I'd set for myself. If I hadn't mismanaged my nutrition, I could have been closer to 3:20.

#### Conclusion

The evidence is there. For me, there is a decided advantage not only in longer distance events, but during periods of high mileage training. The issue of durability that I experienced with the Bondi B2 has not been present with the Stinson Evo Tarmac. The photos to the left show wear after 400 miles. The tread has certainly diminished, and some bounce has been lost, but overall they're in very good shape and should survive many more miles.
