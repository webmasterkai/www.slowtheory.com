In a month I have learned this valuable thing: home ownership is about small victories. I have never lived in a place so large, with so many things, and so many things to be done. The past week I've been flirting with mini-meltdown at the imposing complexity and depth of "the problem", while losing sight of the fact that it's not really so much of a problem. It's just different. Rather than a 600 square foot apartment with only my things, we live in a 2300+ square foot house with our mutual possessions. The walls, the appliances, the floors, the yard...it has all become relevant. I am no longer living in an isolated, "paint-in", bubble where I twist the deadbolt and try to completely disconnect from my environment.  
  
So, small victories. Liz&Liz really liked nailing things into the wall, the floor, the concrete of the driveway, etc. I have been removing those nails and haphazardly applied bits of wood. Beneath their abysmal handiwork is a beautiful, lovely house in need of love and good taste. I like to think that we are slowly bringing that.  
  
Yesterday our new refrigerator was delivered. The previous refrigerator was a very strange shape--narrow, not very deep, and with a disproportionately large amount of freezer space. The reason for its peculiar shape was that it was shoved into a pantry with very specific limitations both in terms of the door opening and available space. We bought the largest refrigerator that would fit. Oh, and probably the fanciest.  
  
After the delivery people dropped it off in the kitchen, I was left with the conundrum of moving it from the kitchen into the pantry. After disassembling the doors and mounting brackets, I was able to wiggle it into the space (with some great effort), only to realize that I'd made a terrible miscalculation--the old refrigerator would no longer fit through the narrowed opening. After some jockeying and removing light fixtures from the wall, I was able to extract the old one. Soon I had the doors back on, and declared the entire thing a success. The rub? The process took three hours. Small victories, indeed.
