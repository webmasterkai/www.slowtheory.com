### One.
  
Bereft the intoxicating--albeit pragmatic--luxury of an automobile, I sometimes find myself in the unique situation of commuting by foot. Granted, there are many other options, including car shares and the bus, but most frequently the ((time + $$$) x reward) equation comes out in favor of simply walking or running to my destination. Historically, this has been for a purpose, when circumstance has dictated that I needed to get somewhere without the encumbrance of a bicycle. For example, when I have attended social gatherings from work via a carpool, my bicycle has been subsequently stranded at the shop. Similarly, when I have sold a bike and opted to take advantage of the shop's free-flowing packing materials and near daily UPS pickup, I have been left far from my home and its ample supply of bicycles. These situations have called for alternative, alternative transportation. Aw, the infuriating self-imposed complexities of life. Lately, however, the evolution of thinking has brought me this nugget: commuting by foot is sometimes quite wonderful.  
  
Average time to work: 35-39 minutes  
  
Pros: fun, safe, traffic-free, easy consolidation of exercise and transportation  
  
Cons: logistically challenging. notably, overcoming the tendency to *sweat* and awkwardness of carrying things like food and clothing  
  
### Two.
  
The organic enmeshment of the kid and his machination--spirited, soulful, mourn-free and giddy, looking back over his shoulder and momentarily losing the precision offered by the neural mess of eyes, shoulders, hands, arms, legs, and core working together to produce this quiet but essentially unstable efficiency. This becomes obvious when the neck twists and wobbling manifests, first from the eyes. If it were left to its own conclusion, the wobbling would become chaos, and the rider--this child--would end up on the ground mystified that anyone in the world is capable of piloting a bicycle. I have only one vivid childhood memory of riding my banana-seat bicycle. I was returning home, so happy and proud, completely unfazed by the reality that I was in a world that had not suspended its order of life and death. Beaming, I turned left, directly in front of an automobile. The orchestration or pure randomness of time meant that it was only a near miss, the kind of thing that an adult quickly dismisses with an evocative *whew*. At that moment, it stuck. It became a part of me.  
  
Average time to work: 20-23 minutes  
  
Pros: adaptability to a given load, fast, easy  
  
Cons: unnatural during the winter, requiring boldness and barely-sufficient mechanical adaptation, expensive, subject to fashion trends  
  
### Three.
  
Apparently, I can take a bus to work, but this morning it would take 48 minutes to arrive at work. Yesterday, I ran home from work in 38 minutes. I would say that the just-slightly-less-than-five-mile trip is a very typical distance for a bus trip. Yes? Well, it shouldn't take longer than it would on foot. That's just nonsense. We need more trains.  
  
Average time to work: 48+ minutes  
  
Pros: I don't have to do anything!  
  
Cons: super expensive, slow, and polluting
