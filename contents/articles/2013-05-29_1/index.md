I spent Friday packing our camping things. In spite of the frenetic pace inside of my head, its execution dragged on mercilessly from mid-morning to early evening. In the end, we had a car full of stuff and a canoe on the roof. Traffic was rumored to be more of a nuisance than usual due to construction on I-35. A discussion ensued. From this, a strategy emerged that we would leave later and camp somewhere just north of Duluth. Around 9pm, we left Minneapolis. It was raining lightly. We would drive until around midnight.

The late departure paid dividends. I would later find out from one of my co-workers--who spent the weekend in Lutsen--that we saved ourselves roughly two hours travel time. We rolled into the parking lot across from Betty's pies just before midnight. Justin and Murray were soundly sleeping in their car.

After discussing the possible hike to a more reasonable campsite, we settled on sleeping in the parking lot. It was late and an earlier start the next day would get us on the water sooner. We quickly set up camp and got cozy inside of our tents. Michelle recently purchased a newer version of the Phantom +32F bag that is compatible with mine. We tried zipping our bags together. It was fun at first, but the wind off of Lake Superior was harsh and we both got cold. Sometime early in the morning I unzipped our bags and declared that temperatures had to be at least 45 degrees to use the zip-together setup.

Nestled between Lake Superior and a pile of dirt.
