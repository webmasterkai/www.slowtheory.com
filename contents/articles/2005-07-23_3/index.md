#### Attempt #3

i am here where broken men of industrious spirit wait to meltdown  
where worn out parts clamor against one another  
and the pleading are upsnobbed by their own generation.

and i am on the youth farms where aptitude tests find me fit for nothing  
where sucklings hang limp from mental health professionals  
and the livid become the subtle moments of my chemical death.

and i am in the streets with the modern druids on their bicycles  
where magnificent factories reproduce the same seven minutes  
and men are delirious with aching sore throats that go unexplained.

and i am in the cemeteries with the unemployed grave diggers  
where the machinery has learned to bury the corpses three deep  
and the poets sing in alternating verse about god and the devil.

and i am in the churches where catechisms have been traded for teleprompters  
where wine burns empty on the way down  
and the words are propped haphazardly like fence posts.

and i am in the laboratories where semen has been subdued  
where cigarette smoke is blown through the nose and tested for toxins  
and the worn out figure out a way to go on living.

and i am in the storehouses where fetuses are preserved by formaldehyde  
where pretty girls run wild with overloaded circuits  
and a monument to our hesitation is resurrected.

and i am here reminded only of my delicate and dirty hands  
only of my sunken and listless eyes  
only of my bawdy and borrowed limbs.

and i am here  
where mine is not a howl  
but only a low moan  
bedridden and anxious.
