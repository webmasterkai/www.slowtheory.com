It was supposed to snow. Or not. Or maybe. It was supposed to maybe possibly snow. After missing two consecutive Sunday rides while on vacation in Hawaii, I really didn't want snow to complicate things. Fuck snow. I indulged in the fantasy that the snow would miss us, scouring the internet for affirmation. "It probably might possibly miss the twin cities." Good enough. I opted for relatively skinny tires, only one of which was studded--just enough to keep me upright the majority of the time so long as weather conditions didn't change. The route was nothing original. There are only so many permutations of "avoid riding on sketchy roads during the winter by utilizing the extensive trail system". It's not bad though, because during the summer the trail system is so thoroughly clogged with dog walkers, roller skiers, and the generally unaware that it becomes both unpleasant and dangerous. It was overcast and slightly colder than I would have liked. I forgot to charge: my shoes, my headlight, and my camera battery. Aside from remembering my bike and food my preparation was nearly a total failure. I also discovered that my last pair of winter tights to be hole free had developed a rather large hole in the same spot as the others. It was not a particularly good start.

We made great time to the Depot. We were about an hour ahead of schedule. With the additional half hour of sunlight at the end of the day the possibility existed that we'd get to do the entire ride in daylight. Strange! Ryan made a quick chain tension adjustment on his singlespeed and we were off. The LRT was in fantastic condition with only an occasional patch of ice. The limestone was very dense with frozen meltwater, so pedaling was almost effortless. A couple of miles from the end they stopped plowing, so we turned around. Ryan discovered that due to not properly tightening his wheel at the Depot it had pulled forward and was slowly grinding its way through his frame.

The way back wasn't as easy. The temperature had warmed up a bit so the trail was soggy. We also were facing the headwind to the corresponding tailwind that Jeff was sure we didn't have. We stopped for lunch just shy of fifty miles. After lunch I felt fast again. We were back on the pavement and everything seemed too easy. It still hadn't snowed and based on the radar there existed little chance that it would.

As we neared the turn to go down Hiawatha Ryan announced that he was going home. Perhaps cruelly, Jeff and I talked him in to continuing. I thought it was strange that he was struggling so early in the ride. This skepticism heightened as the ride went on, and when we got home later in the evening I threw his bike into the stand and discovered a good part of the reason why. In any case, we continued. The sun was out now and my spirits were high. We reached the Vento trail in daylight. It was pleasant, but also slightly disorienting. Since we turned around early on the LRT we added a lap of Lake Phalen to be sure that we'd end at 100. I didn't feel like we were as far into the ride as we were. I felt great. I struggled to restrain myself from pedaling harder.

We reached Jeff and Kara's and got to meet their new dog, a husky named Yukon. He was friendly and along with spaghetti it made for a very enjoyable stop. I didn't want to linger though as it only gets harder to ride the final twelve miles in wet clothing, in the dark. Ryan was really struggling, and it finally occurred to me that the Depot fiasco and subsequent riding had probably loosened the drive side locknut. It was a cartridge bearing hub with axle keyways, so it wasn't terrible but it certainly wasn't good!

I'm looking forward to getting out and riding a fast bike. Theoretically, it should be pretty easy.
