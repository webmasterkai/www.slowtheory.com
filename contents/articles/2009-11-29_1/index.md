It's been kind of a lazy month for me, so after finding out that I would have saturday off I decided that I needed to take a trip somewhere. I had this vision while riding the river bottoms of a primarily dirt ride from saint paul to the minnesota river valley state park near belle plaine. Due to lack of riding partners and enough carrying capacity on the pugsley, I decided to take the lrt instead. The idea would be generally thesame, except the dirt would be flatter, less interesting, and closer to home. At the last moment, ryan decided that he would join me for the ride but skip the camping.

I didn't prepare very well. Threw a few things on the dummy and headed out. Wool and a tent. Not much else. Chaes, a-train and the general were going to drive out and do the camping part and not the riding part. The lrt was a bit slow. The surface was soft and I wasn't as mentally invested as I should have been. I had to remind myself at times that it was a beautiful day and I should revel in what will probably be the last comfortable camping trip of the year.

At the end of the lrt we stopped at superamerica. I put $0.37 of gasoline in a fuel canister. My stove is capable of burning a variety of liquids ranging from unleaded gasoline to jet fuel. After crossing the river we searched for some kind of elusive trail system that would take us from chaska to belle plaine. I wasn't sure exactly what it would look like, but a sign on the paved trail indicated that there were 35 miles of "mountain bike trails" in the area. We started down a dirt road and ended up on a bumpy multi-use trail that seemed to be best suited to horse travel. There were enough bicycle tracks that I assumed we were in the right place. We encountered a few horses, but otherwise it was quiet and peaceful. I hadn't thought much about the fact that it's deer hunting season in minnesota. As we continued the trail conditions worsened. Spots of mud. Wet leaves. etc. Eventually ryan had to concede that he would have to turn back. He had evening plans with a friend and our slow pace meant that he wouldn't be able to make it to the campground.

Once I was on my own I started to worry more about deer hunting. Ominous signs indicated that I was passing through private land and that I should stay on the trail. At once point I passed within sight of a man in a deerstand. He turned toward me with his weapon vaguely pointed in my direction. I was close enough and had enough blinking lights that I'm sure he was just fucking with me. Nonetheless, it was frightening.

The trail got really bad. Mud everywhere. I regretted not taking the pugsley as I trudged along, pushing my bike through the worst sections. This photo was taken with my phone. I regret not getting a better one with the camera.

Finally I made it out of the woods. It was dark and I'd been riding an extraordinarily long time to go a short distance. I was greeted with a mercilessly steep climb. I reached the campground, settled in, called beth. Hi. Hi. Started a fire. I only had three matches so I was sweating when the first attempt failed without even the hint that it might become a fire. I spent more time on the second attempt and I soon had a fire. It was nice.

The bike shop people arrived and we sat around being cold and eating venison sausages. Eventually I crawled into my sleeping bag and went to sleep. It was cold, but I slept well, waking up only once during the night. It rained. The morning was cold and gloomy and I didn't have enough water to make coffee. As they piled into automobiles I had a moment of feeling terrible. It passed once I was on the road. It was a quiet sunday morning and movement was warming me. I had decided to take roads back to Minneapolis rather than the sloppy trail. It was hilly and scenic. Too many cars. Otherwise nice. I stopped in chaska for breakfast.

The ride back on the lrt was unventful. Once I was back on the cedar lake trail I rode with a guy on a seven mudhoney. We talked about bikes, headtube lengths, and I was home before I knew it. The return trip took less than half the time of the trip out. It was still a lot of fun and would have been an absolutely perfect trip for the pugsley. It was only unfortunate that I took the wrong bike for the task.
