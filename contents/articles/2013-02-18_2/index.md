Over the past couple of months, I've decided to stop wasting my time. I'm getting older. Life is getting bigger. I want to explore, have time for the people and things that are important to me. The new objective? *Eliminate things that are effectively in opposition to my happiness*. I've had an iPhone for the past four or five years. Consider the following:

* I've been paying $75/month, $900/year, or $4500 over the course of five years.
* My primary uses have been sending text messages, checking my email, posting snarky updates to Facebook, and occasionally talking to one of five different people on the telephone.
* 95% of the time this occurred while connected to a wireless network.
* Even with the smallest plan from ATT I had banked 5200 rollover minutes.
* Assuming an average bicycle mechanic's wage, the cost of my phone service over the past five years has been 300-500 hours of my life.
* The average employee gets 80 hours of vacation a year.

My new thought paradigm demands this question: has the experience been worth between four and six *years* of my vacation time? Absolutely not. There are so many things in life that I have done without considering their net impact on my life. Things are traded for other things. In the case of my iPhone, I have traded an impressive amount of my time for the ability to communicate in those rare instances when I have not been connected to a wireless computer network. Perhaps this has occasionally been beneficial, but oftentimes it has been not only pointless, but negatively impacted my interactions with living human beings.

The alternative? Port my number to Google Voice. The [Talkatone][1] application allows for free incoming/outgoing phone calls and text messages on my phone while connected to wifi, while Google Voice offers the ability to manage calls and messages natively or route them to other devices. This means that I can have a pay-as-you-go phone for those rare times when I'm going to be out of wifi range for a significant length of time.

Freedom…both in the form of seizing the hours that would otherwise be traded for phone service, and in the enhanced connection with the real world when I *disconnect*. 

So few things are really necessary for happiness. Time to simplify. Oh, and uhhhm…[another way to make things simpler][2].
