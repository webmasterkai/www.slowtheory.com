Friday night Michelle and I left for the Telemark ski resort near Cable, Wisconsin. The plan: a weekend of skiing and shenanigans with 10-15 of her friends (I eventually lost count of people). After a long car ride of listening to radiolab, we found ourselves standing before a *massive* structure that seemed almost too large and cliche to be real. It is difficult to accurately describe this *thing*, except to say that it was too large in every respect. A bit of history would support this theory: its most recent renovation effort is the product of a third bankruptcy and subsequent closing. We watched movies, ate dinner from Michelle's toaster oven, and went to sleep early.  
  
Saturday brought the most wonderful day for skiing. Temperatures were in the high twenties to low thirties, and the air was filled with picturesque--but unobtrusive--flakes of snow. There were thirteen people in our group, so I was nervous. I've been on skis twice since briefly introducing myself to the sport in early high school. Many of the people in the group were very experienced, and while I left my pride back in Minneapolis, I didn't want to cause a massive pileup or piss anyone off with my amateurishness. Almost immediately I found myself looking down a hill thinking, *oh shit, I've never skied down a hill...I wonder what I do?* After one near ski-pole decapitation, I figured out enough to sort-of-competently get down the hills. It was fun. I felt very good on the uphills. I was moving faster than most people and consequently able to ease myself down the other side of the hill before the more courageous and skilled caught back up to me. This pattern continued for a few miles until we reached a warming cabin where we would stop for lunch.  
  
Lunch was delicious. Lara bars, figs, apples, hummus, and carrots. I left with a lot of energy. I was able to appreciate the surroundings a little bit more on the return trip. It was late afternoon when we returned to the resort. The rest of the day was spent doing *absolutely nothing*. We watched three terrible movies and fell asleep.  
  
Sunday we packed up the car and went out for one more loop, this time opting for something "more difficult". I was pretty terrified of the descents, but there were only three of us, so I wasn't as concerned about creating too dramatic of a situation. Most likely it would just be me lagging behind and periodically disappearing in a plume of fluffy white snow. However, I found myself growing increasingly confident on the descents. Additionally, there were a couple of long ascents that suited me well. It was a fantastic experience.  
  
Oh, and we left with passes for two free nights. Looking forward to going back.
