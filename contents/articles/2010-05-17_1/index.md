The official results are in. Finish time was 7:03:40 and good enough for 69th place out of 267 finishers. That's better than I thought. It's amazing that 25 people beat the winner's time from last year on a more difficult course. It's a testament to a.) how terrible the wind was, and b.) how strong the field was this year. It's a shame that all of the gravel grinders nearby have closed their registration for the year. There's a new one starting in Chaska that I would have really liked to do, even if only for the benefit of knowing where to find gravel roads near Minneapolis. I also had Heck of the North on my radar, but I both missed the sign up and would have had to face a lottery to get in. On one hand I'm bummed, but it's also cool to see so many people interested in gravel road racing/cyclotouring.
