After a miserable ride last week in the rain we opted for something a bit different this week--something Matt aptly dubbed a "day tour". The idea was to ride slow bikes at a leisurely pace to a park, eat some brats, drink some beer, and then ride home. We left at about 10am to clear blue skies and temperatures in the thirties. It was a bit chilly, but after a week of rain, sleet and slushy snow it was wonderful. After ten miles I had the chance to take my obligatory duck photo:

Ducks are fantastic. We followed some trails and headed west at the Coon Rapids dam, eventually reaching the Elm Creek park area. We found a picnic area complete with a grill and shelter. Unfortunately the area was situated at what must have been the highest point in the park. The wind, which until that point had seemed insignificant, was quite strong and cold. The effect on my person was much less than on the charcoal, which although easily lit, never got warm enough to cook our food. Matt was smart enough to boil the brats beforehand, so after a significant and disappointing wait we simply put them on some buns and proceeded as if nothing was amiss. The ride was my first ride of more than three miles on the Big Dummy. My xtracycle/outfitters setup has been fantastic, but when the Big Dummy mysteriously appeared in stock with a quantity of one, in just my size, I had to jump on the opportunity. It's been great so far. The most noticeable change is that it rides more like a bike. The freeradical setup can only be so stiff with a design that bolts it to a frame in only three places. The full length frame is much stiffer and more predictable in its handling. Is it worth the money given that I already had an xtracycle? Probably not, but I allow myself a certain degree of frivolity with the excuse that not driving a car allows for it. The ride home was quick. We had a tailwind much of the way and the bratbeer-fuel was hyper efficient (7 calories/gram for the alcohol and 9 calories/gram for the fat--clearly superior to the meager 4 calories/gram of carbohydrates and protein). The sun was out in full force and temperatures crept into the mid forties. Overall it was a great ride. Lots of fun. Lots of food. And a bit of riding.
