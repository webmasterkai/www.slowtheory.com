things are changing. life. people thinking inside of boxes. stratagems/strategies: telling me what to think. except that I don't think like that. (I do sometimes I hate myself for it I'm sorry) last night I watched crimes and misdemeanors. first movie in a long time. delicately packaged my netflix love package and moved on. gathered distance from the mailbox even as I extended my arm into a ten minute guitar riff.

life is changing and I hesitate to tell anyone. will they understand? no. I've been ensnared in my own exuberance in the past. it becomes evidence. "exhibit a," they pronounce.

so I went for a bike ride. roubaix. I never ride it. third ride, ever? I started fairly early, heading east intending to do one of my new favorite loops. I rode along hudson road, making excellent time. "wow, this thing pretty much only wants to go 23mph." crossed the superfreeway and headed south on my new favorite roads. very little traffic. I didn't eat enough in the morning or bring enough in my jersey pockets. that's the bummer about a bike like the roubaix: no way to carry anything. I had so much shit crammed in my jersey pockets that I felt like someone was trying to rip my jersey off of me.

going south was nice. scenic, very little traffic. it was awesome. around mile thirty the leftover saddle sores from almanzo started to bother me. I began to pedal a bit bow legged. this was nice since if I pedal naturally my thighs hit the flattened top tube of the roubaix. it's not much of a problem except when my legs get slightly tacky from perspiration.

I reached military road feeling good. that would change. quickly. I got really hungry and had very little energy. to further complicate matters, the wind had picked up since I left and I was now facing a formidable headwind, amplified by the endless expanse of fields and rolling hills. it was an unpleasant stretch of road.

I stopped near battle creek and almost threw up on powergel. I hate that shit. I brought it only as easy to carry energy to use in an emergency. it was pretty close to being an emergency.

blah blah blah. the ride was over. I went out for coffee. sipped it slowly. loved it. squandered time. it is now.
