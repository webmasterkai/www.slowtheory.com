I woke up to sunshine and a disoriented sense of time. My legs felt tired but I decided to go for a bike ride anyway. I didn't have a route in mind. I went south along the bad side of the other side of the river. I almost never ride the Minneapolis river road because it's in horrible condition and has many more areas where the road is only wide enough to accommodate two automobiles. I was bored though, and I followed the river road to Minnehaha Parkway, where the roads were in even worse condition.

The Ardennes wheels again impressed me on the rough surface. It definitely wasn't like riding the 2 balloon tires on my xtracycle, but the wide rim gave the impression of at least a 25mm tire, if not a 28mm. Also in their favor is that they haven't been destroyed just yet. For a 1400 gram wheelset on the roads that I've been riding that's a pretty amazing feat. Today I was also testing out some new road shoes. They were quite comfortable and much wider than the Sidi shoes that I had previously that would make my feet numb within five miles. The stiffness was weird at first. I've been riding in cycling sandals and winter shoes for a while, so the absurdly stiff sole (a 10.0 on their scale!) took some degree of acclimation. Near the end of my day my right knee developed a slight pain, but I think it was more from cleat adjustment than anything with the shoe. 

On the way home I saw a very old woman on a mountain bike with aerobars. Her handlebars were at least four inches about her seat and she was wobbling all over hell. I contemplated stopping to explain the purpose of aerobars and the dangerous position that she was putting herself in for almost no benefit, but I decided that it was probably better that she was out on a bike at all, no matter how ridiculous and deadly. 

My legs didn't really feel good all day. It was still nice to get out and enjoy the weather.
