We woke up to one of the only sunny days that we'd see during the trip. It was delightful and inspired a leisurely start to our day. We ate a greasy breakfast and visited Artists' Point, before eventually starting our walk to the trail. It was two and a half miles on the Gunflint Trail to the intersection with the SHT and another mile to the trailhead parking lot. Our trek seemed to be taking an impossibly long time. Michelle was admittedly grumpy and I feared that we were in for another slog that was neither fun or fast. We reached the turn for the trailhead parking lot and realized that part of our seemingly unending walk could be attributed to walking a mile in the wrong direction. *Sigh*

Once we were on the trail, things improved. Michelle's gloominess subsided, the slumped shoulders lifted, and she was back to her ebullient self. We found ourselves connecting with nature in a way that the brutal conditions the previous day did not allow. The sun was shining, temperatures were pleasant, and we hadn't made any firm commitments on distance or pace. We were just savoring the opportunity that we had to enjoy a crisp autumn day together in the woods. Our vague intention was to reach Lutsen in three days, at which point we were considering shirking the forecasted snow and renting a room on the ski hill (perhaps with a jacuzzi and a fireplace?). 

The climb out of Grand Marais eventually brought us to the North Shore State Trail, a 2.5 mile section of snowmobile trail connecting two ends of the SHT. To break the monotony of walking on a snowmobile trail for an hour, we stopped for lunch. The nice day allowed us to indulge in an exquisite feast. We made coffee, ate quinoa, snacked, and lounged for almost an hour. The quiet was serene, with solitude enhanced by our growing distance from Highway 61. Whereas the previous section of trail was always within earshot of highway, our lunch was blissfully free of noise pollution. We packed up our things, after which Michelle broke into a jog. I followed, thinking __"Huh?"__ I wasn't sure if it was a coffee fueled scamper, an attempt to warm up after sitting for so long, or a subterranean love of running in the woods. In any case, I went with it.

We mostly jogged until reaching our entrance to the singletrack, where we once again met dramatic birch forests and a fun, twisting trail. The day was going well, and I thought it might signal a rejuvenation of our broader effort to hike the majority of the trail. When we reached a campsite shortly before nightfall, I urged us to push into the dark, attempting to cover another five miles to the North Cascade River campsite. This would offer the potential of reaching Lutsen in two days rather than three, restoring the possibility of reaching Duluth with our feet. The night brought its own mystique. Wolves howled while the moon blazed its way through the sky. My world shrunk to the size of my headlamp's beam.

As we were closing in on the campsite, Michelle asked, "How are your knees?" I thought it was a weird question since my knees felt great. "They're great. How are your knees?" "They're starting to hurt," she answered. "Where?" She indicated a spot that was very familiar to me from my six month struggle with and IT band injury. Damn. We agreed to assess the situation after a good night's sleep. Once we stopped moving, I realized that it was *cold*. I put on all of my clothing--3 layers of wool, a down jacket, and my rain jacket--and got to work setting up our shelter and finding a spot to hang our food bag. Meanwhile, Michelle made dinner. We'd covered around 17 miles and were extremely hungry, making dinner a spectacular display of efficiency. We quickly devoured our food, cleaned up, climbed into our sleeping bags, covered our faces, and prepared for a long, cold night.
