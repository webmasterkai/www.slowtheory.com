I kept my words mostly to myself in October, so it might look like I only rode my bicycle in October. *Not true*. Other things happened. I just didn't share. It was too much. Seasons are changing. Experiences are diversifying. Hopes, ambitions, *loves* are spreading out, becoming pervasive. I'm seeing people for what they really are. Sometimes this is lovely. Sometimes it is horrifying. I am sleeping when it pleases me. Sometimes I got to bed at 4am and sometimes I wake up for the day at 4am. Today was the latter. Tomorrow might be the former.  
  
Things are changing. The cast of my life. The plot. The narrative. The narrator. Id/I/me/this/that.  
  
But still I ride my bicycle. This is my constant. My solace. My people. October was just fine.
