we did the same 75 mile route. fog. daylight savings time. hills. etc. my brain felt only half into it, but my body proclaimed that it was having fun! we hit the first big climb--vento to the top of mounds--at the same speed as we reached the top. dubious. I sort of wanted to excuse myself in a dry heaving ball of fury and self contempt, but I didn't. we kept going and we kept making it to the top. highwood to mcknight to sterling was the quintessential fucker but the last few on indian trail seemed equally harsh, if only because of tired legs and a skewed perspective. in the end it was fun but I'm going to need a nap.
