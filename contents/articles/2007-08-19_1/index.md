cold espresso leaves behind a silty residue. I play with it in my teeth. I watch it streak down the side of my cup. I am, undoubtedly, interacting with this cold, inanimate thing, toying with placing it on the end of my tongue and letting it dissolve in a trail of darkened saliva. 

it's been cold and rainy for the past day and a half. I've been thinking a lot in that span of time, degenerating into an incomprehensible pulp of dream. I woke up early this morning, went to the bathroom, and flopped back into my bed. I'd already slept much too long and the images assaulted me in my half conscious state. I dreamt something about growing old to young, about becoming the origin of the changeling. the images were bizarre and I don't want to think about them. 

on thursday I ran fifteen miles. I struggled psychologically, weaving between fits of irritability and exultations of delight, my feet beating themselves into the texture of sandstone. in many ways I have adapted, become congruent with the way that I imagine myself when the lights are dim and I am oozing with narration, repeating in my mind words and conversations, trying things in different voices. I run at this indefatigable goal because it distracts me.
