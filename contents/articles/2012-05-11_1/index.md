Six people showed up to the start of the Thursday gravel hundo. Only three would finish the route, but that was planned. The others were compelled to report to their "jobs". It started fast. I sat in the back contemplating the future effectiveness of my malformed breakfast pancake, which had turned into a pile of goo drizzled with maple syrup, spooned lethargically into my mouth while watching the sunrise. This is the sort of indulgent breakfast that I eat without joy onÂ *ride-day*. It usually takes me an hour to settle into a ride, so it did not surprise me that we were almost to Chaska by the time I started to feel good. We hit the big, but not big at all, climb and I had *legs*. Some days it just works out. The group split up at this point, with three of us headed to Watertown via the gravel, and three headed to Victoria via the pave. We powered through the gravel. The sun was out. It was still morning when we passed through Watertown. A few miles down the trail we stopped at the Ox Yoke Inn for lunch. This was a marvelous decision. Now fully fueled, we returned to the Luce Line and pedaled another couple hours, ending at the Longfellow Grill patio. Awww, what a day.
