### Running from Mill City

I talked Ken into joining me for the Friday morning group run from Mill City Running. I generally don't join group runs--as I'm simply too slow--but my increased desire to run with other people prompted me to *think outside of the box*. It was about a two and a half mile journey to the start. We took it pretty easy, settling in around an 8:45 pace. When we arrived at the store, there were already at least a dozen runners there. I never cease to be impressed by the ability of the running community to attract a broad range of people to its events. 

The course was a five mile river loop with the stone arch bridge marking the southern end and the bridge at Broadway marking the northern end. The early pace felt reasonable. I didn't have my watch set to display such information, but I guessed it was somewhere around 7:45 min/mile. As we crossed the river, the pace increased and the group split. I remained with the second group, hoping not be the last person back to the store. I followed three women up to Broadway, doing roughly 7:30 miles. I was nearing my *fastest possible five mile pace while still being able to talk* pace when the conversation turned to me. After exchanging the typical information like name and running experiences, I learned that one of the three runners will be on the Ragnar team that I recently joined. Weird!

We were soon back the store, where Ken and I took a few minutes to regroup before running back to my house. I ended the day with 10.1 miles and a 7:42 pace for the Mill City portion of the run. As someone who is running on a broken bone and is generally not very fast, those are pretty good numbers.

### Running from Split Rock River to Tettegouche

On Friday night Michelle, Bunda, his friend Jaime, and I drove north towards Tettegouche state park where we would meet up with three more of their friends--Char, Jason, and Todd. The plan for Saturday was a run between the Split Rock River parking lot and Tettegouche state park, just south of the Baptism River. The projected mileage for the run was around 27, but you never know with the SHT. 

After a chaotic morning and multiple trips to and from the park, we found ourselves at the trailhead. Six of us were running, while Michelle planned to just relax and explore Gooseberry state park. I hadn't felt great all morning, but I've learned that it doesn't really matter on long runs whether you start out feeling great. It's a long day and things change. About 0.25 miles into the run, we rocketed past a turn, opting to defy logic, good sense, and due caution and head south on the trail. There seemed to be varying degrees of recognition regarding the mistake (the fact that the gigantic lake was on our left seemed the most compelling evidence), but ultimately, it took another 1.5 miles to reach a unanimous admission of folly. We turned around, reached the turn, and began heading north. Our mistake *only* cost three miles, but it meant almost an hour between covering those three miles and stopping to assess our situation.

We were now heading north. That was good. I felt pretty awesome and was happy to be exploring a new part of the SHT. The section after 14 miles (now 17) was familiar to me, so it was a nice mix of new and old. I looked forward to being on familiar trail, but I also relished that during the most mentally active part of the run, I would be exposed to new things.

The accolades of the group were genuinely impressive: marathon PRs ranging from the low to mid threes, multiple Boston qualifying runs, multiple 50 mile finishers, and race winners. I was mildly intimidated and concerned that I would slow the group down. Nonetheless, I felt good and just focused on enjoying my time on the trail. I knew that I could *almost* keep up with Bunda based on our recent race results, so at most, they would have to wait for me for twenty or thirty minutes at the Tettegouche parking lot. 

A major concern soon emerged: we were moving slower than I expected, tacking on more than an hour through the first ten miles. I was hungry, and I'd only packed food for around six hours. *Shit* I would periodically recalculate the totals, but kept determining that I was in a bad situation. I had planned for around 200 calories/hour, but with our projected finish times, I was looking at around 120 calories/hour. I hadn't given it much consideration while preparing, since water was a far greater concern, but it was becoming an issue. I considered two strategies: conserve and run on empty all day, or eat what I needed and deal with running out of food. I decided to eat my food and deal with it when I ran out. Two options came to mind: run down into Beaver Bay when we crossed Lax Lake Road (+2 miles), or call Michelle and talk her into bringing food to the trailhead. 

At some point, probably earlier than I'm describing here, it started to rain. Despite the optimistic forecast, I sensed that the remainder of the day was going to be 50 and rainy. Bunda and I tended to be off on our own, while the others lagged behind a bit. In the rain, it was a difficult situation to manage. We would yo-yo, I would get cold, we would yo-yo more dramatically. Combined with my pressing food situation, I was in enough of a situation to call Michelle around mile 13 to see if she could meet us at the trailhead. I wanted food, but I also thought she might be helpful as we made decisions about the rest of the day.

It was a glorious sight when we reached Lax Lake Road and Michelle was just pulling into the parking lot. She had picked up some pastries from a local bakery. I began devouring them, while shivering in the intense rain. We continued this blissful, chilling buffet on the trunk of her car until the others arrived. Jason was the first to say that he was calling it a day, but the others soon followed. They all ran seventeen challenging miles in shitty conditions, and I applaud them. I knew Bunda would keep going. I also knew that I would keep going. The back seat of that car looked warm and cozy, but I knew that I didn't have it in me to stop. Plus, I really wanted to see some of the amazing sections on the upcoming trail, like the Bean and Bear Lake overlooks. 

We finally departed. It was mid-afternoon by now, the rain was relentless, and the temperature was 51 degrees (the recorded high for the day was 54). I really enjoy the stretch along the Beaver River, so I was excited to get back into the woods. I'd been feeling a little bit off all day, so I was also thrilled to stop at the first campsite and use the latrine. We reached that spot after about a mile, I collected some broad leaves, and headed into the woods. Officially, it had become an *adventure*. Yep, pooping in the woods transforms any run into an adventure.

We ran pretty well, but the trail from Beaver Bay to Tettegouche is one of the hardest on the SHT, and I could tell we still weren't moving very fast. There were numerous sections that were so rocky and steep that I would have been hiking them on my best day, completely fresh. Nonetheless, the miles passed with relative ease, and we soon found ourselves near Silver Bay.

Somewhere around this point, we saw a sign telling us that we had 10 miles to the Baptism river bridge and 6.3 miles to Mount Trudee. I expected that we had about 7 or 8 miles remaining, total, so it quickly became a low spot for the day. My energy levels were sagging, the sections of trail that should have been runnable were made slow by soup-like mud, and we still had some of the most difficult terrain remaining. Ryan and I had hiked the section we were on several years ago in better conditions, and it was all that we could do to cover ten miles in a day. Nonetheless, our choice was to move forward.

Around mile 25 the rain ground to a momentary halt and we found ourselves at the Bean Lake overlook. We took the opportunity to sit on a rock, have a snack, and enjoy the beauty of the Lake. I started feeling much better, convincing myself that we might even be able to connect to the parking lot where the car was parked without going to the Baptism River bridge. We returned to the trail with renewed vigor. I was definitely not finishing with the speed and energy that I have been in recent races, but I was still moving, running where it was possible, and feeling decent enough.

At the base of Mount Trudee, my Garmin ran out of battery, meaning we'd been on the trail for over eight hours. This number was already without any possible explanation, as we'd each recently run the Eugene Curnow on similar terrain in under six hours, and we still had somewhere between one and two hours to the car. We hiked most of the climb to the top, emerging to see the fog covered hills where we'd been and would be going. It was one of many moments during the run in which I felt wholly alive. This is a feeling that I wouldn't have known existed for a long time, except that I experienced it once. Now, it is a drug.

We reached the top of the climb, made it down a difficult descent and inched closer to the finish. At a trail intersection we found a map that gave us a good idea of how to reach the car without going to the bridge and back. It was only a mile, but there was a steep climb, and then a slow descent down "The Drainpipe". A bird tried to kill me in the final mile, but I survived and we were soon jogging into the parking lot.

I threw my hands in the air, spun around like a madman, and just laughed. Joy like I experienced in that moment is rare.

I don't know exactly what happened on the trail. I cannot understand why it took us ten hours to travel 31ish miles. Even the mile splits on Strava don't make any sense. They generally range from 12-16 minutes, with a couple 17s and 18s. None of the numbers add up. None of it really matters though. It was an adventure, and I had a brilliant time.
